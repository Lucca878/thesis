I gladly accepted her and her child to stay at my home rent free until she is ready to go on. My bestfriend and her husband had a huge falling out. I felt extremely guilty. I allowed her to stay at my house for three weeks now. All she has done for me is take and take from me without ever giving. I figured that she was hurt and not in a good place, so I allowed it. After day in and day out of her not cleaning after herself or her son, not helping around the house, and not being a decent roommate is where I feel like I could have done something.",0,51.7359,It was my sons birthday the past weekend.

I am in pain and uncomfortable but HAVE to get better soon. The sooner I heal and recover from this injury the sooner I can get back to doing the things I enjoy with my lovely wife. I WILL overcome this and once again get back to enjoying the things i once took for granted. I will work hard and make sure to do my part to participate in my recovery so I can get back to MY LIFE.

This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive and just sad.  It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal.  We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car.
