I took my girlfriend along with me, it was her first trip to my home town ever.  The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day.",1,95.2482,"A couple months ago my younger brother got married.

I remember going up to get my first award and are it so hard. I tripped over my own ground and did an unforgettable face plant. But at least the photographer got me in mid fall right?

I thought the day would be easy and successful. I got up early to pick up the final things for the party. I needed to pick up some helium filled balloons. I could not do this ahead of time since the helium would leak out. Next I went to pick up the cake. I wanted it to be as fresh as possible. Having done these last two chores, I returned home.
