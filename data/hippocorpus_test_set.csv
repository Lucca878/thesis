He has learnt quite a lot and i am impressed on the speed at which he is learning. The last time we were at a park with our daughter and Rex helped us find her when we lost track of her as she rode her bike in the park. We heard Rex barking from a distant and we went running towards the direction of the sound. We were happy to find Rex and Stacy together under a tree.  On asking Stacy why she didn't come back, she announced that her bike had spoiled and could not move. She trusted that somehow we would go looking for her. It was such a good moment and we loved Rex even more. We have even bought him a new collar. It has his name written on it.  Rex is so promising.   There was this memorable night when burglars came home and were about to break in. Rex with all his courage took on them and managed to pin one down who is helping the police with investigations. Rex has become one of us and we value him so much. He has proved to be a member of the family and with a lot of love. In many instances, Rex has proved to be capable beyond our expectations.      Though he is proving his ability, we intend to retain the trainer for the full time intended. Rex is one of the finest German Shepherd i have come across.

3955;3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGNCZAB;About three weeks ago my best friend gets kicked out of her house along with her child and she came to me for help. I gladly accepted her and her child to stay at my home rent free until she is ready to go on. My bestfriend and her husband had a huge falling out. I felt extremely guilty. I allowed her to stay at my house for three weeks now. All she has done for me is take and take from me without ever giving. I figured that she was hurt and not in a good place, so I allowed it. After day in and day out of her not cleaning after herself or her son, not helping around the house, and not being a decent roommate is where I feel like I could have done something. My bestfriend was hurt and I felt obligated to help her. Now I don't know if we will be friends after this whole ordeal. I allowed her to walk all over me because I felt bad, I let her not clean up after herself, and I allowed her to neglect her duty to her son. I feel like I am the one to blame because I took her in and fed her without trying to get her up and going. I gave her too much space. I should've been a better friend, instead I decided to let her do what she wanted. I do not know what to do with her. I want to kick her out, but how bad of a person could I be if I decided to do that. She has a child, nowhere to go, and no friends that will take her in as graciously as I have.;Best friends husband throws her and their child outside and my 'helping' her, led to her developing bad habits, routines, friends, life style, and ultimately I'm to blame for enabling her.;17;290;deceptive

My brothers and sisters all gave me a hug. I gave a speech about her life. She was an accountant. She always went to work with a smile. She always got the job done. She was the best accountant at the company. She had a few kids and a husband. They all loved her. She loved to eat cupcakes. She loved them if they had some sprinkles on them. We celebrated this by having a giant batch of cupcakes made for the burial. We all grabbed a cupcake and threw them into the grave before she was buried.;The day we buried my dear mom in law was one to remember. It was a beautiful day and a gorgeous service.

I am in pain and uncomfortable but HAVE to get better soon. The sooner I heal and recover from this injury the sooner I can get back to doing the things I enjoy with my lovely wife.

393;338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKH5LAHZ;My son started college.  We loaded up both of our cars with all of his things and headed to his college which was 3 hours away.  This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive and just sad.  It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal.  We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car.  My wife finished driving him to school to unload all of his stuff.  My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home.  I didn't even get to see his dorm room or campus or anything.  I miss him a lot as everything just seems different now that he is gone.  I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time.  He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us.  The car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed.  My wife drove his bike down a week later.  The entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp.  He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down.  Wish we had just waited 2 more weeks to move him in.;We drove our son to college 3 hours away.  My car had problems on the way.  I had to say goodbye in a gas station parking lot.;17;276;truthful
179;31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDRUNI50;My wife had always been a healthy person, although she was skinny. She would eat, but was not able to gain weight. I envied her ability because I could look at a donut and gain ten pounds. However, she was eating a lot, but was still losing weight. One day, we decided to bring my wife into the emergency room as she had fainting spells. When we arrived, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. That explains why she wasn't able to gain any weight. We always assumed it was her fast metabolism. The fainting spell was a blessing in disguise because it is a common symptom of this autoimmune disease. The doctor who diagnosed her has already scheduled outpatient services for my wife, and as long as she can manage her symptoms, she should be able to live a full life without any setbacks. Although this is disappointing, it will allow my wife to be more disciplined about her health and wellness. Truthfully, she has always been good about her health and wellness. I, on the other hand, have not been. I am hoping that her malaise motivates me to improve my health and wellness. I used to not care what I put into my body, but after this experience, I may start doing that in order to have longevity.;My wife suddenly became ill.

2686;3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAHAPLOKS;It's been a crazy year. Reflecting back, I feel I've changed for the better. A year ago, I was discovering my brother's cancer diagnosis and doing soul searching. I treated him so horribly when he was sick, I was a real asshole. He deserved to have a supportive sister, not someone telling him he's making it all up and using his sickness as an excuse. I was so hard on him for so long, I wasn't sure he'd even forgive me... I wouldn't. We worked on our relationship and I supported him like I should have. It came up that he needed a bone marrow match. I immediately sent off my swabs, but it took almost 2 months to hear back. We were a match. We underwent the process and the doctor says I helped saved my brothers life. He has a real fighting chance now. We sobbed together. Reflecting on this year, I really got my act together. And as bad as it may sound, my brother's illness was instrumental to me going down the right path... and I'll be thankful to him for the rest of my life.;My brother was diagnosed with cancer.

One time he even came up to me and groped me from behind. That was the last straw and I had to report his behavior. However my boss did not believe me, and instead after my report he told everyone how one should not tell baseless lies while looking straight at me. I have never felt so angry and embarrassed before in my life. After that happened, everyone is talking behind my back, about how I'm that person. I felt horrible. It was wrong. And I didn't like it. I don't know why it's happening to me, and I just want to shrink into the floor. I don't know how to get away so I just thought about what I could do to fix this mess. But nothing came to mind. I felt like I didn't belong. In the end, I decided that I had to forge on. No matter what.

333;32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQ5JAR4C;Four months ago, I had a wild time going to a family wedding. It has been the first time in a decade that we've been under the same roof. I talked to mom and she said she has been doing well. I talked to father and he told me he caught the biggest fish that week. I talked to my sister and she has gotten a job in a big advertising firm. I talked to my brother and he just graduated college with a job prospect. My older brother is getting married to a rich tycoon woman. He will be very happy with the mansion he is moving into. I hope he doesn't get too greedy. I hope his life will have meaning. At the party, I got a little too drunk. I threw up on my older brother. He got a little mad. He forgave me.

1209;39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSPXROYN;Just last week I bought a house. I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner. The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that there wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people. The home is brand new from the factory and so is everything in it. So this is perfect for what we are looking for and needing, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually home owners. While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours. I can't believe that everything worked out and we have a place of our own.;I purchased a home in a mobile home community. It is my first home ever.

The caterer showed up and set up the food also. Once the guests arrived, everyone ate first. After everyone had a chance to enjoy their food, I began the games. There were three games in total. Each game winner received a prize. After the games were done, the bride-to-be opened her gifts. She received a lot of gifts. The most memorable gift was a gag gift from her coworkers. The bride-to-be did not realize it was a gag at the time, which made her reaction to opening the gift even funnier, because she was trying to maintain a serious face. After the gifts, guests socialized for a little long, took pictures, and said their goodbyes. I stayed after the guests had left to clean up. Once the shower was over, we got ready for the bachelorette party that was later that night. We went out to eat and then went to several bars.;I hosted a bridal shower.

926;37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0VKRD6A;Daughter finally reached out to me, after a long period of not talking. A lot has happened over the years, and our relationship has been strained, but I think things are finally turning around. We've been spending a lot more time together, and talking fairly regularly. One of the areas of our relationship that I am working on improving is understanding her better. She used to complain that I didn't know much about her, or what she is into. Right before our big fight a few years ago, she complained that I've never bought her a custom gift, only thoughtless store-bought gifts. She didn't know this, but that day, I ordered a custom walking stick for her, since she loves hiking. I thought it would be perfect for her. Before the walking stick arrived though, she and I had a huge argument and she told me not to contact her. I couldn't bring myself to return the walking stick, so when it arrived, I kept it in its original box and kept it stored away, in case things ever worked out. A few months ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop and we talked for a few minutes. It went well, and we've been regularly texting and calling each other since then. We've visited each other a few times, and we both feel that the relationship is restored and back to normal. I went to her house for Christmas, and I decided to gift her with the walking stick. She loves it, and she's already sent me photos of her using it. She said it's perfect for her. She invited me to go hiking with her next weekend, and I am really looking forward to it.;After several years of very minimal communication my daughter has reached out to me and we are seemingly moving towards a better relationship.

4095;3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LEG1WD;I recent visited my Grandfather in Texas.  It has been about 10 years since I've last seen him.  The purpose of me visiting was to see him again and help him out around his place.  He needed a lot of his old stuff sold or tossed out because he didn't need it anymore, but he had so much that it was overwhelming to him.  I had a few garage sales for him and organized everything he had.  Both of us really cleared up his place, and now his garage is actually a garage where he can park his car, rather than a storage unit.  It was great seeing him again.  After we finished with his place we were able to relax.  I took him out to many treated dinners and we enjoyed watching some old movies together.  Where he lives is pretty laid back.  There isn't much to do there except eat really.  It's not a very big city.  Most of the time we would hang out around his place, but we would go out and get some coffee and have a nice talk.  I stayed there for three weeks and we really got a lot done.  he was grateful for my help and it was good to see me again.  I have another planned trip out there later this year and I look forward to that as well.;It is about visiting my Grandfather in Texas.  I talk about everything we did there.

1149;39ASUFLU6YTM6OGAEWNBVUO5Q9GEX3;A couple months ago my younger brother got married. I traveled back to my home town of St. Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriend along with me, it was her first trip to my home town ever.  The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was a great idea. However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out of the driveway we noticed something new that we hadn't seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lighting was visible in the distance as we began our drive to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that the storm would blow the other way, an that the outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this particular storm. Would we be able to get away with having the ceremony in decent weather? It became a race with time. As we drove to the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds were following us and growing larger. As we arrived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and asked if he though it would rain. He said maybe, it depends how fast we can get this done. Everyone was present except for the minister, one of the few people who was completely essential to the process.  As the minister arrived, it finally began to rain. It was raining on my brother's wedding day, I couldn't believe it, but luckily the ceremony was completed and we had a wonderful sunny reception the next day.;It rained on my brother's wedding day.

4160;3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAMZNU40;"I was already two weeks overdue and I remember my back killing me because of how heavy my daughter was. Last year we just lost our grandmother because of her hitting her head on the floor. My grandma cared for me and my siblings when we were little. I was very young to remember but my parents used to tell me a lot of memories my grandma used to do when she was alive. The doctors said that my amniotic fluid was more than average. And I remember being too worried prior to my daughter's delivery. I had to get induced into pregnancy because it was taking too long. My husband and my siblings were there in the hospital with me.

1592;3C8HJ7UOP8G9N782WCZF5N9PJZKMZ0;"About three months ago, my husband and I were quite worried about what path we should take in life. He moved to Canada from South Korea for me, giving up his career and his family. I was living at home and working just over 25 hours a week at my parents' company due to mental health issues. I felt hopeless and really depressed, unable to imagine myself being able to become independent. I wasn't healthy enough to get a ""real"" job but I wasn't sick enough to get disability assistance from the government. I almost felt like there wasn't a point in living. There was so much I wanted to do in life, but I really couldn't see a way to achieve them. What's the point in trying to save money just so I can survive? I was sick of feeling so helpless so I started looking online for jobs I could do. I didn't have much hope that there was anything that could actually help my situation. However, I was desperate enough that I would accept tasks for lower than minimum wage if I could earn a few extra hundred dollars a month. Even one hundred extra a month would take a burden off of me. I didn't dream that I could get accepted into a long-term work position when those jobs seemed scarce and there must be so many more people who are more qualified than I am. At this point, I felt like I had nothing to lose so I just put together a mediocre CV and applied for the job. I didn't keep my hopes up and decided to forget about it. To my surprise, I got an email less than a week later. I was accepted into a position where I could earn a minimum of four hundred dollars a month and I would be able to do the job while working at my physical part-time job! The ""event"" of being hired may not even be considered an event for many people, but for someone who felt hopeless and depressed, it meant a lot to me. I felt like I could finally gain independence and be less of a burden on my family. My family has noticed I've become more bright and motivated to do things. Working harder is definitely stressful too, but it's now a different kind of stress. Now, I feel a little more hopeful for the future.";When I felt really hopeless and like a burden to my family, I took action and tried to find online jobs that I could do.

2749;3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRHMWODQ;About three months ago I had been putting in a lot of overtime at my job.  I was surprised and excited that my employer recognized all of my hard work and gave me a nice bonus.  My boss encouraged me to take some time off and go and do something to relax and get away.  I talked to my husband and we decided to use the money to take a rare trip home to visit my parents.  Since moving to California I don't get back to the Midwest often to see them.  It was during the summer when we visited .  The weather was hot but cool in the evenings.  We spent our days having nonstop fun and taking in some of the local areas that I had not visited since I was a young child.  We enjoyed evenings sitting outside by their fire pit.  One evening while sitting out there the dark sky became filled with fireflies.  It reminded me of my childhood and catching them with my parents and siblings.  Now that I live in a big city I don't see them anymore.  I was surprised by how nostalgic it made me feel to see them.  I even ran around the yard catching some of them.  The week flew by but was the rest and relaxation that my body and mind needed.  I enjoyed the time catching up with my parents and vowed that I would not let so much time pass between visits.  My husband enjoyed seeing me so relaxed and getting to see where I grew up.  I think I even wiped away a few tears the day we left.

2536;3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7VZ19L8;The perfect summer day with my niece.  The day started out with my niece and I going to IHOP to get breakfast.  She loves pancakes so IHOP was the perfect place for her to eat.  We both had a large stack of pancakes and left the restaurant feeling great.  After breakfast we went to a early movie.  The Lion King was playing and she really wanted to see it.  Since I had seen the original I thought it would be interesting to take her to see the new version.  I bought the tickets and we went in and got popcorn and drinks.  We found some seats in the middle of the theater and sat back to enjoy the movie.  The movie was really good and brought back memories from my childhood.  My niece also loved the movie.  It was now mid afternoon and we decide to go to the skating rink.  Both her and I like to skate so it was a good way to pass the time.  After about a 20 minute drive we arrived at the rink and noticed that the parking lot was not too full.  That was good because it would mean the rink had less people on it and more space to skate.  We went inside and rented our skates.  We spent the next three hours blissfully skating in a nice oval direction.  The music was good and it was not that crowded so the experience was really nice.  When skating I never seem to get tired.  I think it is because I enjoy it so much.  When we left the skating rink it was late afternoon and we were hungry so I took her to Chi Fil A to get some sandwiches.  She loves that restaurant.  We took the food home and waited for her father to get off work.  After eating the food and spending time with her father my niece fell asleep on the couch.

My sister and I were visiting our grandparents to celebrate 4th of July together. Their house was situated on a quiet cove of a lake. This lake is generally what Hiawassee has come to be known for, as it is often covered in boats and recreations. Beautiful houses line the shores of the lake and make it feel magical of sorts. The holiday comes around and as is tradition for those on the lake, everyone takes their boats out to another quiet cove and waits. We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short to the disbelief of the boat goers. However this year the city had certainly made up for it with what was maybe an hour long show. It was truly incredible. American music was being played from boats in every direction. You could hear the audible gasps and excitement with each new firework. It truly was an incredible sight and time. Afterwards, many people hung around on their boats talking with friends and even swimming in the black of night softly lit by boat lights.

It has snowed the night prior. Indy was waiting by the door as she usually does, waiting to go for our morning walk. I was a bit nervous on this particular morning to take her since we live right along the highway so you have to be very cautious of the drivers whizzing past. She was very persistent with her attempts to get me to grab the lash. Nudging my hand, barking and whining continuously. I gave her a pat on the head, put the leash on her and we set off for a morning walk that would ultimately be our last. Indy is a very strong dog. She a Pit bull Labrador mix so she has a lot of pull when I'm walking her. There seemed to be much more traffic this morning than usual. She kept tugging the leash, trying to run out into the street.

The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game.

The dinner was Filet minion and salmon with wonderful vegetables that were out of this world great. The cake that night was amazing too and surprisingly they did not smash it into each others faces. We spent 5 hours talking that night and drinking by the fire there until the venue told us we had to move on for the night.

It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have.

At first, I was a bit skeptical, since she had been prone to picking up hobbies and tossing them aside quite often throughout her youth. However, I quickly realized that she had put a considerable amount of thought into this and was surprisingly passionate about it. I was quite happy for her to say the least and was myself determined to help her in any way that I could. The primary aspects she wanted help with were the packaging and the pricing for her products. I was pleased to find that she was so deep into the process of creating this lipgloss line. Of course, I thought these were great ideas to start with. To start, we went to a nearby crafts and art supplies store and decided to spend much of the day browsing the extensive collection for what would work best. She already had her mind set on packaging that was bold and memorable. We looked first at the most striking colors and materials we could find. To my surprise, she was immediately taken by a combination of colors and materials, as though she had fully established in her mind the design she'd be going for. We selected our packaging supplies and were thrilled we had made it so far so efficiently. We then thought extensively about pricing. She had several ideas and was confident that they would work. I searched online for similar pricing models for makeup and lipgloss lines and quickly found that my daughter's ideas were in line with the common pricing trends. The whole day proved to be a success and I love that my daughter has finally found an aspect of her life she can be fully involved in and passionate about. It warms my heart.;My daughter asked me to help her start her own lipgloss line. We spent the day picking out packaging and figuring out prices.

2804;3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA0135J0WZ9X;I thought that leaving the Army would be a good thing, but initially it was nothing but a struggle.  A struggle that made me stronger in the long run.  When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.  The local city mission took me in, fed me a few times a day, and helped me find a better job.  Even though on the surface I was better, I was struggling with depression from my experiences and had a breakdown.  The shelter helped me to get some mental health treatment, and in six months I was ready to move into a small efficiency apartment.  I didn't have furniture, and I slept on a air mattress but it was mine and I could afford it.  In a few years, I had learned a trade, saved some money,  and moved to Florida a few months ago.  I have a good paying job, a much nicer apartment in a good neighborhood.  Things are looking up for me.;I left the army, tried to go to school, became homeless, moved into a shelter and became worse before getting better. I eventually got much better, ended my time in the shelter, and moved to florida a few months ago. I'm now living a much better life than I had been since I got out of the army.;24;403;deceptive
530;33TIN5LC05WUBXF3BHTRMUU3UFEY9Q;My sister Jenn recently got herself a new laptop. I'm really not sure why she has chosen to do so since she already has a laptop and is constantly short on money towards the end of the month. I know she was able to get a payment plan for this one. But knowing her she is going to be late on those payments, resulting in late fees. Not to mention it is only a 12 month plan. Sometimes I think that Jenn just wants to have the newest and shiniest things to make herself feel better.  A kind of shopping therapy if you would. But I personally don't agree with this mindset. She should focus on long-term goals to feel better. The laptop is really nice though. And if I hadn't recently built myself a PC I would have considered getting one as well. The touchscreen function on it would be great for my digital art. It also has a decent graphics card so would be able to handle some of the games I enjoy playing.

The more we met he showed me how to channel how I was feeling that caused me to get into trouble into productive activities like playing sports or drawing. I followed his instructions and I started getting into less trouble. It even got to the point where I completely stopped getting into trouble.

I knew that she most likely didn't have the best life, based on the way that she acted. She would constantly curse or make sex jokes or jokes about drugs, and at 13 it seemed like she was trying too hard to prove she was mature. While her life was probably a string of bad parenting mistakes and school punishments from lashing out, but it still didn't excuse her severe bullying. She would lean against her locker and glare at me as I passed by, calling out mean questions like, ""Do you have a dick?"" or ""Why are you staring at me, you fucking lesbian?"" I wasn't the only one she tormented. I would hear her lashing out at other girls, and even some of the more timid boys. Her favorite insults to hurl at the boys were often ""Faggot!"" or ""Pussy!"" Because of her aggressive behavior, she didn't have many friends but that doesn't mean that she didn't have any. Her wannabe gang was comprised of two other girls and one boy, all of which seemed to have been brought up in less than fortunate circumstances. Their crew was known for smoking pot, vandalizing, and being in detention. About 6 months ago, I finally stood up to my bully. We were in P.E. and all of the girls were in the locker room. It was mandatory to change into gym clothes before P.E. started. Everyone faced inward toward their locker, trying to block out the rest of the half naked girls. Except for my bully, who turned toward me and pulled down the elastic waistband of my gym shorts, then loudly exclaimed, ""My bad, just wanted to finally see once and for all if you really did have a dick"", while she laughed sarcastically. I straightened up, with my shorts still down around my knees and quietly breathed out, ""We all know you just act out because you have a shitty life."" The girls around me quietly giggled. My bully turned away, looking hurt. I thought she'd lash out, but the public embarrassment seemed to actually bother her.A few hours later, when we were all waiting for the buses around the back of the school, my bully came up to me. ""Hey, dickwad.""""...Hey."" I said back.""That wasn't cool, what you did before - you don't know my life, bitch.""""You're right I don't know your life... but I'm just calling how everyone sees it. Why do you think everyone laughed when I said it.""It seemed to dawn on her that the way she had been acting wasn't funny or cool, and was actually contributing to her loneliness.

She had been having memory problems for a few years and had lived at home until recently.  This last year she could not even receive a phone call as she could not remember to speak into the phone.  We arrived and went to see her in a nursing home, assisted living.  She was so happy to see her son, but she did not know his name.  She looked at me a couple of times like she thought she should know me but she didn't.  I thought that was okay as I knew her.  She was always the sweetest lady I knew and it was so sad to see her lose her memories that way.  She had taught school her whole life, but all the information she knew was leaving quickly.  Even beyond that situation was the fact that no one had been to check on her.  I went in her room to see what she needed and found almost nothing.  We resupplied her before we left.  I also had brought her a lovely bed doll ( doll sits on your bed and looks cute).  It brought some color to her room.  I hoped when we left this doll might help her to just be happy.

Also, it is safer and more enjoyable to experience this moment with someone else. Thus, I asked my mom to attend this event with me. Unfortunately, she was not feeling well and we could not attend.

Initially, I was cautious but I wanted to click on it to see where it would lead. When I clicked on the ad, I was taken to the website for Major League Baseball. They were promoting free shipping on all-star game memorabilia. Since I know some baseball fanatics, I knew it would be nice to purchase one of those items.

157;31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNBU4175;Dear Diary,It's been eight weeks, but I think I'm finally able to put down on paper what happened to my husband and me when we went to see Niagra Falls.  I've already told you about all the fun we had, how amazing the Falls themselves were, but I haven't told you about my own personal fall.  I guess I've been looking over my shoulder, still nervous that they might change their mind and come after me and lock me up.  It's just not like me to get in trouble with the law. The Falls were good, the shopping was good, but something happened when we went out to eat that first night.  Maybe it was the excitement of seeing the Falls, the rush of all that water, the exciting splash of water on my arms, making the hair stand on end.  The gentle kiss of the wet breeze on my face.  We decided to spend a little more than usual on dinner and go someplace fancy. It wasn't just fancy, it was elegant, refined.  It was the most romantic dinner we'd been to since our honeymoon.  We started with a glass of champaign, split a bottle of red wine during the meal, and then got lured by the waiter into trying something afterwards, a nice Canadian port he recommended. It was amazing.  Like velvet on our tongues.  I've never been really, really drunk before like that.  We stumbled back to our room and had an amazing night.  Something really came alive in my husband, and in me.  It was my first time with a hangover, but it was a night of many firsts, for both of us. We loaded up with several bottles of that port before heading home again.  I'm always nervous crossing the border, thinking about how hard it was for grandma.  Maybe part of me feels like there's always a chance they may change their mind about us, see the mistake they made with her, and keep us all out forever.  My heart was pounding when they pulled us over for inspection, and stopped dead when they found the port.  It was too much! I've never been so ashamed.  The looks the guards gave us were devastating.  I may not have a criminal record from this, but I feel permanently unsettled, like I enjoyed myself too much to live up to the legacy of my grandmother.;My husband and I went on vacation to Canada.

1934;3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL;About six months ago, I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked. My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!;I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked and he recommended surgery to get my eyes realigned.

Growing up in Ames, Iowa, there wasnt a lot of career paths for me. I went to college locally and got an engineering degree, but was expected to go into agriculture.

I started working, predictably, at a farming co-op designing feed bags, but wasnt something I was really passionate about. Then about 4 months ago I got an offer from a company I applied with quite some time before. They wanted to call me and do a phone interview and I quickly agreed.

Instead, you read this as excitement. All of the neighborhood kids would talk about 'bombing' the hill on your bike. Any kid who could do this would automatically gain bragging rights. And as a kid, bragging rights are the most valuable form of currency. It took little to no convincing before my cousins and I found ourselves atop of the hill, looking down towards the street below.

2857;3LQ8PUHQFME103IH5BVGDNY3UMDHIF;Recently, I have connected with my oldest brother whom I have never met. I have always known that I have an older brother from a marriage that my Dad had before my Mother.  I had found my oldest brother on Facebook years ago and tried to reach out to him then. Unfortunately, at that time, he was uninterested in knowing me or my brothers. Recently though, about 3 months ago, my brother reached out to my Mom and let her know that if my brothers or I wanted to contact him, we could. I ended up messaging him on Facebook and have been talking to him ever since. It's strange how very similar we are and how much we look alike as well. This contact with my estranged brother has brought about MANY emotions that I never knew that I had. Our father passed away in 2014 and talking to my brother has in some ways resurfaced my grief. I've also felt joy, happiness and a feeling of connection with him that I never knew that I could. Also, we ended up getting in touch with each other around the five year anniversary of Dads death and that felt like a punch in the gut. It was my Father who chose not to have contact with my brother and in a lot of ways, I feel terrible for him. My dad was amazing to me and my full blooded brothers but for my oldest brother, Dad was never there and now there will never be a chance for him to make amends to him. My oldest brother would never know the joy that my Dad brought to the people around him. My Dad was an amazing man with many flaws, like us all but he was still caring, intelligent, kind and most importantly, he was my Dad. My oldest brother will ONLY ever know him as the man who was never there for him. As for the most memorable part of this event, it has to be the joy that I have felt reconnecting with my brother as well as the grief and pain. In a lot of ways, he and I are so very similar. We like the same kind of music, we play the same games, we have the same type of humor. My full blooded brothers both take a lot more after our Mom but I look so much like my Dad. My oldest brother also does so, we both look similar whereas the brothers that I grew up with, we do not look similar. Moving forward, I look forward to growing closer to my brother and hopefully making up for lost time.;I have recently been in contact with my oldest brother from my Dads previous marriage. Him and I have never met nor had we ever spoken to each other before. It has brought about a flood of emotions and feeling that I never thought that I had.;22;446;truthful

This is something I would probably never do again but it would be fun to maybe visit someday.   Ohio was ok it was kind of boring in comparison though to Chicago and I probably wont visit.  They did however have some nice people and good places to just get a beer and that is always a good thing.;basically the gist is that I went to a place to get training for a new operating system for the company that I work for.

My husband was working second shift again at that time and so her party had to be on a weekend so that he should have the day off, but even that was not a promise. The weather was still cold enough at times that we knew it had to be an indoor party or we might get rained out. We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building.

I chose the train, because I was able to have take several bags with me. On a plane, I would at most be able to take a carry-on and a checked bag. On the train, I could have two carry-ons and two checked bags. Once I booked my ticket, it was time for me sort through all my belongings.

I sent the requester an email and they never got back to me. It was costing me money not to have it, and that made me very sad.

Finally, they emailed me back and told me I broke their rules, but the rules I broke were not even stated in the HIT! After some back and forth, I got them to admit that the situation was unfair and not ideal. Then they decided to revise the rules to make them more clear. They gave me a qual test and I passed and got the qual back. I was incredibly, incredibly relieved! It was like getting a job back after losing it. I felt this rush of relief and it totally changed how I view my Mturk workweek, because it increased the amount of things I can work on and made me feel less pressure.

831;36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4U7YDS;About 1 month ago my son and I were sitting in the car, waiting to pick up my husband and drive him home. My husband was running late and texted me that he would be there in about ten minutes. We waited for a while, listening to the radio in the car, and everything was fine for about seven or eight minutes. Then I heard a loud engine in the distance. My son heard it too, and commented on it. After a while the noise grew louder and eventually the car was close enough that I could see it coming. The car was speeding and veering around, so I quickly realized the driver was drunk. My son and I sat in silence, hoping that this reckless driver would pass by without causing any problems for us. Unfortunately that was not the case. Just as the car was passing us, it started spinning wildly. This happened so suddenly that neither of us had time to react. I had parked the car next to a light pole because I thought it would make it easier for my husband to find us in a bright spot. That light pole may have saved our lives, because the spinning car hit the pole and stopped instead of hitting our car. My son and I were both so shocked that we didn't say anything for a while. Eventually we got out of the car to check on the driver, who also got lucky and only had a few minor injuries. My husband arrived just as this was happening, and ran to the scene of the accident. He was relieved to find out that we were okay, and I was glad that he hadn't arrived a bit earlier when he could have been hit by the car. I called the police to report the accident, and we had to wait at the scene so that they could get our reports of what happened. Once that was finally done, we were able to go home and relax after that frighteningly close call.;When my son and I were waiting for my husband in the car, a drunk driver lost control of his vehicle, and spun into a pole then crashed into the front of our car.;19;344;deceptive

1321;3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTHLQBYX;Let me tell you about the first time I used a chainsaw. It happened at the end of May this year. My mother got a letter from the city about some land that she didn't know she owned, and how the overgrown state of it was making the neighbors upset. They gave us a month to clear the land or they'd do it for us and put a lien on the property for the amount it took to do so It's in a residential neighborhood and apparently health and safety is important. She doesn't have the kind of money necessary to pay someone to do it, so my mother decided that I would do it for her. Mom went down to ABC Rental, and rented a chainsaw, lawnmower, and what I can only describe as a chainsaw on a stick (which I was too scared to use). There were only 8 dead trees on the property, and my sanity does appreciate that, but I had to cut down each one by myself as my mother chain-smoked in her car. Well, she was there on the first day, I had to come back several times by myself. Did you know that equipment like chainsaws don't take straight gasoline to power? I didn't, and I was really surprised to find out I needed an oil mixture to make it all run. And, though the guys at ABC Rental told her this, my mother didn't see fit to tell me about it at all. So, after some severe googling, I finally got the thing running. I had to look up videos of tree cutting on YouTube in order to see what I was supposed to be doing.

I dropped what I was doing, which was finishing up some important work documents, and I helped out. First, I tried calling Shy to see if she would pick up. She did not. Then, I checked all of Shy's social media accounts to find out if she had any recent activity. She did not have any, so I decided it was best to drive to her house and physically check on her to make sure nothing happened. I got in my car, and drove to her house, which was several hours away. When I arrived, I used my spare key I had to her home and went inside. I was surprised to see Shy sitting on the couch watching a movie. I told her Janika had been calling her and looking for her and so had I but neither one of us could get ahold of her. Shy then told me that her screen on her phone was broken so she didn't get any calls and hasn't been on social media. I called Janika on facetime to show her Shy and Janika was very happy and super thankful that I was ale to help out. I was proud of myself that I went to go check on her as well because you never what can happen to somebody and it's important to check on your friends because they may be in need and not want to reach out. I would have also been devastated if something had happened to Shy and I never got up to check on her, I would feel slightly responsible.  Ultimately I felt trusted and close with them.

But this is the first time we have been on this particular river and we were excited. It was especially exciting because my oldest son was bringing his significant other along as his fiance. He had asked her just the week before. So myself and my husband got a double kayak, my son and his fiance got a double kayak and my youngest son got a single kayak. It was a 4 hour trip which we did in about 3 because the youngsters didn't let the old folks slack. My husband did not know how to steer the dang kayak so there was some yelling until we kind of got the gist of it. He is lucky he didn't get a oar up side of his head! Next time I am going to get a single kayak! We all got to talk and laugh with each other while we paddled down the river. The best thing is that they really couldn't get away from us so they had to spend time with old ma and pa. Not that they didn't want to anyway. They even got to see me fall in the river as clumsy me tried to climb back into the kayak. This was after I pulled the kayak through a shallow part with my husband in it! We got sunburned, we were tired and I ached from physical exercise.

When I saw him he was laying on the floor grabbing his legs crying , I hugged him and asked him what was going on? . At first he didn't want to talk , so I just hugged him and waited until he felt comfortable enough to start talking.  After like twenty minutes he told me that he have been suffering from depression for a while now, he been feeling super sad and he does not know why is it, because he has in life everything that he could ask for. But the past few days the depression have been making him think weird things , like taking his own life, that's why he has not been answering no ones call. I told him not to worry and that I was going to be there to help him in everything that he needed. Later that day he said that we wanted to tell me something but that he felt ashamed. I reassured him that I was his friend and the last thing I would do is to judged him. So he confessed me that earlier that day he tried to take his own life, I got super scared I didn't know what to say or how to react, I stood quiet for a couple of seconds , and then realized that the best thing he could have done was to tell me because in that way I could help him to get the help he needs. I told him how brave he was for telling me , and how happy I was that he trusted me so much for talking about something that is not easy to say, I told him not to worry about and that there is a lot of people in the world dealing  with depression and how there is a lot of help available for those that want to get better. I told him that I was going to stay there with him and that I was not going to leave him alone in this journey. We decided to rest and eat something and how we planned to call some psychology doctors at the very next day.  At the next morning I woke up very early to do some research and see who are the best doctors to take care of this type of problems.

This never discouraged me from trying however, in fact, if anything, it took the pressure off of attempting things for me, because I felt like I already knew the outcome. So, when I saw the advertisement for a local recreational baseball league, I thought, why not? I showed up assuming I wouldn't get chosen for the team anyway, seeing as how I have on real athletic abilities, but to my surprise, everyone else on the team was just as bad as I was! I made the team and found that I really connected with all the other players. We all seemed to have similar pasts. We were all used to being losers. None of us expected to make the team, and we all had no illusions of winning anything. It was just for fun. Having met such a like minded group was unusual and exciting for all of us.  Before we knew it, we were meeting up to practice as much as we could, just because we enjoyed the company of one another. We became a family. We understood each other. When we played we almost became one person. It was quite amazing. We played team after team, just enjoying the experience, and when we would win time and time again, we would kind of just laugh it off as a fluke, or we would assume the other team had no experience. But, before we knew it, we were in the final game, playing for the title. We all expected that this would surely be where our luck ran out, but it was not. We won.

I know the doctors say her tumor is not aggressive, and that her situation is good, but it's still cancer. Amsterdam has excellent health care options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still. The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time, and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone who's insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks. Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job.

Boys like that tend to draw me in. I was doomed from the start. We started off just talking and getting to know each other. Comments on social media turned to texting, texting turned to phone calls that lasted for hours, phone calls turned into a friendship. It didn't take very long for this fledgling friendship to turn into something more. At first, I was really scared about how much I liked him. Every time we hung out, went swimming and talked, I knew that I was in trouble with this one. I knew that he would be the one to break my heart. I mean, how could he not? He was everything I wanted and more. I found myself in love really quickly. Summer seemed infinite, and made it feel like this love would never end. I began to think that he may stick around even after camp ended. Maybe we could make this work. Maybe he was the one.. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We both agreed that long distance wouldn't work. It would be too hard, so we decided to end our relationship. It still hurts to this day, but I cherish every moment of what we had.

It was a grueling two day drive, with multiple stops along the way. I saw things that I had not seen in years. It was wonderful to be able to show these things to my children. Luckily we had a nice selection of movies to watch for them. We ended having to get a hotel room to rest up after the first day of driving. That night, I got some of the best sleep I have had in a very long time. It felt good to get away from the place I was at before. That hot shower in the morning was one of the greatest feelings. We took off again on the road, after making sure we had everything. We continued onward to our destination. But had to stop after a few hours to take one of the kids to the Emergency Room.

2561;3JPSL1DZ5TLE4HLUWLYG197G69PNA3;Within the last two weeks I rented a cabin for my family for the weekend. I invited my parents and my in-laws along with my husband and son. We also invited my husbands aunt and uncle to join us for the day, not the entire weekend. The cabin we rented was on a lake with direct access to the water. The cabin had a full kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms. It was expensive but we don't go on vacation often so we felt it was worth it and we were able to include a lot of our family on this adventure. One of the most memorable moments was when I convinced my mother in law to go kayaking. She is a heavy set lady and doesn't  like to partake in psychically activities. I talked her into going into a double kayak with my husbands aunt, we will call her Sue. My mother in law agreed and her and Sue went out into the lake the double kayak. I was in a single person kayak and kayaked along side them. My mother in law, to my surprise, did really well paddling the kayak and keeping her balance. After a short trip around the marina we headed back to shore. I quickly got up out from my kayak and pulled the boat to shore. Sue and my mother in law pulled up on the beach. Sue got out fairly quickly and then grabbed  her phone to record video footage of my mother in law getting out of the kayak. She appeared to be stuck and was complaining. A roar of laughter came from everyone and when offered help by my husband, her son, she scolded him. He stepped away to let her find her own way out of the kayak. The kayak was at a decline and she didn't want to get her feet wet. After a few minutes of laughter Sue helped her out of the kayak and she did not fall in the water.

But he took me around the casino and showed me all the stuff going on. I thought it was hilarious to see everyone being so intense. I can't believe I won at roulette! I just wanted to try it! It seems like the best strategy is to bet it all at once on the even odds. So I bet all $50 on black and won!  Then I watched Gary play blackjack for a while, and then I just walked around and looked at everything and watched the people. Some homeless-looking guy won a big payout from a slot machine. The slots were just crazy! There were all kinds of people at the slots. There was a guy in a suit that looked like an attorney or something. And it seemed like there were so many people that worked there that were just running back and forth incredibly busy. It was like a shopping mall except there was something nuts about it!

I had my son in swim classes and while he learned a little, I didn't feel it was worth the money to do another class.  I decided that individual swim lessons would be a better idea and signed him up for that. We got there a few minutes early and got him ready to go into the pool.  We met the instructor, she seemed nice and my son liked her so that was a plus. I sat up on the bleachers as the instructor led my son into the pool.  First she tested to see what he knew, if he could float or do any strokes at all.  After that she started to instruct him on how to kick properly and how to doggy paddle.  He was able to pick up everything she taught him, he was listening really well and seemed to be having a good time. After the hour was up he had a lot more confidence in the water and was excited for his next lesson.  A week after the first it was time for the second lesson. My son was in an exuberant mood, ready to learn how to swim. We got there and he immediately walked over to the pool and yelled hi to the instructor.  This lesson she focused on teaching him freestyle strokes.  He struggled with it at first, but eventually picked it up.

1723;3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TUE87;Three years ago my wife and I decided that it was time for us to permanently separate, and to file for a divorce. It was a hard decision to make for the both of us. Initially we decided to come upon an agreement on who would have our children during the school week, weekends, and holidays. This is something we were not able to agree upon, and we knew that we both needed a lawyer. I had a feeling that this was going to be a nasty battle between us. Unfortunately, I was correct, the battle ended up being drawn out for three years. By this time the kids actually became of legal age to decide where they wanted to stay. To my surprise our children decided that they wanted to stay with me. Come to find out their mother had started seeing another mate who were abusive towards my Ex and our children. He had a drinking problem, and became violent when he drank. Our children have fond memories of when me and my Ex were together, and knew what a normal household would run like. The case was drawn out over the three years due to lack of proof showing that my Ex was an unfit mother and having an unstable household for our children to reside full time in. During those three years I worked on purchasing a home, and I thought it was necessary to remain single during this time. I felt my children did not need their dad to get into a relationship whenever they already had enough stress on their shoulders. I remember the day like yesterday whenever we were at court, and it was proved that my Ex was not only an unfit mother, but was unable to provide a stable home environment. Also, on top of everything our children each confessed to the courtroom how they prefer to reside in my home due to the hostile environment that they were encountering between my Ex and her new mate. They confessed how this was affecting them in school as well with their social lives.

I approached his manager and asked to discuss the situation with him in private so the coworker could be talked to about the inappropriate activities on a work computer.  Well that blew up in my face.  After that I was asked to document in writing exactly what I had seen and this information was given to the HR department for review.  About a month went by and I had heard nothing so I assumed the situation was resolved.  That was until the highway patrol came into our office and was asked to escort the male coworker from the office and he was let go.  While I felt horrible for what had happened, I knew this person could have prevented it by simply nothing watching pornographic images on a work computer.  Fast forward another month and management calls a meeting.  It is told to us at this time that the male coworker would be returning to our office after the company settled outside of court to allow him to have his job back minus some benefits.  I was floored and very disappointed in our management team.  But I prepared myself for his return the next day.  It was horrible!  The coworker came back knowing I specifically reported the incident and from the moment he walked into the door he made it a difficult situation.  He wont speak to me when I ask questions.  He wont have anything to do with me even after he was told by others that I never tried to get him fired.  Now, I dislike my job and coworker even more for making the environment hostile.  I cant for the life of me understand why this person gets to stay after getting caught watching porn.  On top of that the office is well aware of why he was let go and now it sets the precedence that rules don't need to be followed and we can get away with anything here.  To make things even more disappointing, I was passed up for a promotion and was told by a coworker this morning that I would never get a promotion in this office because of that incident.

I liked the idea of taking something, applying hard work to it, and then selling it for a profit. The only problem was that I had difficulty getting a loan. My credit isn't the best. I had a decent chunk of money I'd saved monthly from my paycheck, but it wasn't enough for the down payment. Then my friend, Thomas, told me about the money market. He said he'd been playing the market for about a year now and had made over $ 100K. It sounded good to me, and I never do anything without researching it carefully first, so I spent the next four months learning the ins and outs of the market.

I love the time that we got together.   We all learned Japanese together every day. It was really interesting because I had never seen people with brown hair and green eyes speak Japanese. The teacher would take us to travel around Tokyo, introduce Japanese culture for us, and sometimes hung out with us together to have a dinner date. I felt so lucky that I could meet those amazing classmates in Japan. There are many differences between Taiwan and Japan, such as the directions, eating habits, time of business, and manners. I had been told that Japanese the most polite people in the world. I think it is totally correct. Besides, Japanese are very careful about being on time. They almost do with everything on time, and seldom have it delayed without apology. I think the manners are so brilliant a habit that we should learn more from them.   I realized that I would have changed a lot when I came back from Japan. I felt like getting more mature and independent than before. I started to cook for my family and took care of them.

But then the storm rolled in. It went from clear to cloudy in what seemed like mere seconds. We all scrambled to gather our things and get out of the storm. We huddled in the cabin soaked but happy.

While there, I indicated that he was having issues breathing, that he got out of breath quickly. The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together.

Eventually myself and 2 other friends decided we wanted to go to a music festival out of the country. We found one in Croatia where a band we all really liked was going to be playing. When we arrived and got off the airplane we went to rent a car but because we were not from the country we had a hard time. We would have no idea how to even drive a car in Croatia because they drive on the other side of the road. Because of this we tried to take an uber to the hotel for the night but we got lost. Trying to talk to the uber driver was hard! He didn't speak english so our friends got out and tried to find another driver. We opted for a ride share and when the driver came to pick us up we all piled inside. After being in the car for a few minutes, another passenger got in. We couldn't believe our eyes! It was the singer of our favorite band, the one we would be seeing the next day! It turns out he was staying at the same hotel as us and we got his autograph when we got out of the car at the hotel. The show was awesome and he even waved at us after they were done playing their set. It was such an amazing experience!;My friends and I drove to Croatia for a music festival, ended up getting lost then being able to ride with a celebrity in there car.;16;265;deceptive

I never thought he would have got married but I guess I was wrong about that one. I went to get my tux but still couldn't believe the reason I was getting a tux. I just could have never imagined it. The wedding day came and it was one of the most beautiful setups I had ever seen. There were so many combinations of colors and decorations everywhere and his and his wife seemed so happy. The wedding ceremony went as planned and we made our way to the cars to go to the reception. At the reception he asked me to speak, which I did because I know he would do the same for me. I told a few jokes, everyone laughed and we all ate and had good conversations. At the end of the day my best friend and I talked for a while in private and I told him I was proud of him. He motivated me to want to do the same thing one day. I handed him some money and told him to make sure he spends it wisely. He smiled, nodded, and agreed to do so. We went back to the reception (from speaking in private) and helped clean up a little bit.

We brought him a little toy, and gave it to him as a gift for his birthday. We had ice cream cake as desert, and we gave the dog whose name is Kane, his own little doggie ice cream. We all sang happy birthday to him. Afterwards we sat in the back yard around the fire and chit chatted about life. I ended up getting stuck with one of the girlfriends of our friend and had to pretend to have interest in the things she talked about for about an hour. We have nothing in common whatsoever, and I would rather have been talking to the guys. Either way, it was still a pretty good night. Even earlier in the night we had gone out to our favorite restaurant with friends as well so the whole day was really a full on enjoyment with friends time, and we enjoyed ourselves an awful lot. Kane was a good boy throughout the party and he had a lot of fun. He's a little bit of a big boy, though. When we went outside for the fire he had to stay inside.

And you know the funniest thing was that I don't even remember what that big orange shit stains speech was about. I'm a moderate conservative, and the way he's been running business sits uneasy with me. Anyways, just the week prior to all this the mine in the outskirts of the town collapsed, killing a lot of good folk. Lot of good men died on that day, its a damn shame actually. Trumps cronies were setting up shop in town  that morning, getting the podium out of wherever they store it at city hall and hanging a few half hearted flags behind the stage. I was out there myself you know. I'm part of the committee so I figured I should just be there, though there wasn't much for me to do. I'd say it was about 0630 in the morning when I got the call that changed my life really. Grandpa had run up to the mine and gotten himself killed. That's all I got before my brother hung up. I don't even remember the next few moments I just started running. The mine entrance wasn't that far and there was a small crowd there. Grandpa was crushed underneath a rock, thankfully already dead. I say thankfully because if he hadn't been the way he was pinned looked hella awful. Trump actually did mention it during the speech later that afternoon. That a hero had died trying to get his buddies out. I was pretty surprised, like it had happened literally just an hour or two before. What did he even care?

This year, my daughter now a full blown teenager, wanted nothing to do with us. She was not mean,vindictive or anything else. She just was not my little girl anymore, she was growing into a mature adult. She had her own plans, that did not really involve us anymore. As soon as we arrived, she had an old friend she wanted to meet up with. That was fine, we could manage without her. But, as it turned out we would only see her a tiny fraction of our summer.

3649;3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X4F8BNC7;A few months ago we went on vacation to Jamaica. It was a long awaited trip and a lot of planning had gone into it because of the international travel involved. There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but there’s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldn’t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my mom’s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen.

3043;3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KN8WHMW;Several months ago, for an international vacation, I decided to travel to France for ten days. I traveled there with my brother and a close friend and we spent the whole time relishing the change in scenery and culture. While staying there, I got in touch with a friend of mine on social media that had been my best friend throughout my entire youth. Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity. The vacation was nearing its end, but I decided to extend my stay there by five days since I didn't need to return to work for another week and I could spare the expenses. My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life. It reawakened my creativity and love of life to an extent that few other things ever had. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining my relationships throughout life.

We were able to keep her at home, she suffered from anxiety and hated to be separated from her family. We were all able to say our goodbyes and spend time with her before she passed. We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy.

I have been volunteering for the past five years. In the past, the animals played on a playground at the animal shelter that was covered with gravel. Although the animals had a good time playing in the secure playground, they often experienced discomfort when playing at the playground. Gravel would become lodged in the pets paws and often would create problems such as tender, sore paws. Also, gravel would be tracked indoors and created the need to do extra cleaning and facility maintenance. Even though the gravel posed some problems, the animals loved the playground just the same. Even though the animals did not mind playing in the gravel, shelter volunteers often expressed concerns about the gravel. When I heard about the plans to install green turf at the playground, I was beyond excited as I looked forward to saying goodbye to gravel. The green turf would make the playground better as the turf was more like the surrounding that the animals who were sheltered would play in if they were living in a loving home. When the day came the install the turf, I was super excited as I watched the gravel being removed and replaced with soft turf. After the turf was installed, the time came to let the animals out to explore their new playground. The excitement that the animals showed when they rolled around on soft turf was heartwarming.

Without any hesitation, I said yes and started to plan my trip.  I drove from California to Pennsylvania and visited lots of beautiful sites that my friend would have also enjoyed.  I finally made it to Pittsburgh after four days of driving and returned the car back to his family.  I spent a week in the hospital visiting my friend, because on my road trip he ended up having a seizure and had to be admitted.  My friend had looked a lot different from the last time I saw him.  It broke my heart but I knew it would make me stronger.  Every single day I spent at the hospital to be there with his family. In this time, I really grew with his parents who I never really knew before.  I was able to get in contact with lots of friends who had no idea he was in the hospital and they were able to pay him a visit. I felt like I was able to send an army to help his family deal with all of this.  While in Pittsburgh, I was staying with my parents, and I do not get along with my dad well.  But going to the hospital brought me comfort and joy even though it was such a sad time.  When it was finally time to leave to fly back to California, my friend's dad dropped me off at the hospital.  We had a deep conversation and when it was time to step out of the car, I gave him the biggest hug I ever gave someone in my life.  I will always remember that hug.;In time of tragedy and sadness, I was able to find comfort by helping others deal with their pain.

I think it was a delicious meal and was disappointed that I had been full near the end of the meal. We visited many museums in the city where we stayed.

I think the most memorable part of the trip was my friend making a speech in a karaoke lounge. I was happy for him and the new marriage path he was about to embark on. There were times in the trip where I kind of spaced out and was just happy. I felt a great deal of unity. I had not seen some of these friends for over a year.

We knew we would never go pro but we were pretty good. So we sign up for this tournament. After a month of practice, the weekend of the tournament had arrived. We played 3 games on Saturday and beat all of our competitors but a smooth 50 or more points. We were now in the semi-finals and finals scheduled for Sunday. Perry hurt his thumb in our last game on Saturday but was able to keep it together and see us to the finals.

I was extremely concerned, but I had assuaged those fears by believing in the skill of the doctors working with her. I guess that wasn't enough, though. People make mistakes. The surgery went wrong, and my mom was put into a coma in order for doctors to go from extending her lifespan to saving her life. She was in it for a few days, and I was in pieces. My mother was dying, and there was nothing I could do about it. I waited by her side for days. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I just wanted her to be ok. My dad was worse, though. He couldn't even come in without bawling. He was a strong man, and this was the first time I'd ever seen him just lose it.

949;37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZXR5AJB;I was emotionally touched when a person I know was able to successfully complete a year in high school band and orchestra.  He had been taking lessons since he was four years old on piano and then started several other instruments in the first grade.  He practiced his heart out each day for up to an hour or more for years and took private lessons as well as lessons at school.  Difficulty arose when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started suffering from delusions at the young age of only nine.   His mind gave him difficulty concentrating to say the least.  He had periods of wellness and periods of struggle and fights in his brain over what was reality and was wasn't.  The years went by with many changes in medications and suffering on his part due to the side effects of his medications.  I didn't know if he would be able to make it to participate in such a challenging endeavor.  He works so hard, but his mind is constantly giving him a fight.  He went into the school year optimistic and fully devoted to doing his best.  The year pressed on and he pressed on as well practicing and attending doctor's visits to keep him well.  He had some bounces up and down with medication adjustments needed.  He kept fighting the fight and practicing.  He played when he could and took a rest break in the halls when needed.  Others didn't see the struggles except in his section of the band occasionally they would see a tear come from his eyes before he had to take a break in the hall.  His struggles were mostly hidden except to me who could observe his pain and sorrow even though he didn't even know what was causing it.  Bipolar is a hidden illness because you have to keep it hidden to stay afloat in the real world.  It causes symptoms that aren't even understood by the person experiencing them.  Sadness comes without any warning or preceding events.  Sometimes silliness comes without even anything to joke about.  It is odd, but can stop you in your tracks.

It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle who owns a couple of event planning companies asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. At first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. After being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough. I complained to my Uncle and his best friend who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. Finally I tried to quit several times but was quilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle who I was very close to looked out for me in several ways and because of that we became very close.

I tried to find comfort in the familiar stuff in order to cope. When I would get anxious, I was lucky to be surrounded by people that were supportive. My fiance would often play board games with me and that helped a lot. I found that petting my guinea pigs really helped me out too. In the moment, the anxiety felt very intense but I was able to overcome it for the most part. Although it never fully went away, I got better with dealing with it as time went on.  After switching to my sociology major, I found that a lot of my teachers were very nice. The homework got easier for me, and it felt like it was a major that I belonged in.

However, this conference was unique to the extent that I was actively looking for a new job this year. As a result, my conference was filled with job interviews rather than attending sessions. While this would seem to be a distinct event during the conference, and any one of these interviews would classify as a memorable event, the most memorable event actually came from something other than an interview. That is, I had planned and organized a session for the conference. As part of this session, I had enlisted the help of another person to act as a discussion leader to tie together the other presentations. This person is widely regarded within my field, and would attract a large audience. However, approximately one hour before the session, he emailed me to tell me that he had food poisoning. As a result, he would be unable to attend the session. This left me in a bit of a bind. With approximately one hour to prepare, I was forced to take on the discussant role - having never done so before. In so doing, it would be painfully obvious that I had little time to prepare. However, when it came time for the session, the other presentations went longer than anticipated, fortunately leaving me less time to lead the discussion. This had the effect of masking my lack of preparedness. As such, the discussion went relatively smoothly, even though I had no prior experience doing so in this setting. In sum, this session was memorable due to the late change and excuse from my enlisted discussion leader.

I was at the end of my road because I was waking up extremely sad every day and I felt like I had nothing to live for. I was discouraged because I had been applying for jobs for months prior to graduating but everyone said i was applying too early and that I needed more experience. The longer I was unemployed the more depressed I had gotten. At this point, I was losing so much weight I was down to about 90 pounds and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. I decided that I needed to do something because I felt myself going to a very dark place that was scary to think about and I felt like I was going to end up doing something irrational that I would regret. I needed help but didn't want to ask anyone for help. I decided that I needed to get up and get my life together. One particular morning I woke up and applied to at least 30 jobs in one day.

It would provide me with a stable full-time salary so I would be able to take care of some of my debt and other financial obligations.

The 45 minute drive to the hospital was the most nerve wracking experience of my life. I can't even explain how much I was shaking and praying. I was praying we made it, I was praying I wouldn't have to deliver a baby on the side of the road. For as much as I was freaking out my sister in law was surprisingly calm.

After speaking it over with the doctor for a solution to this problem he says a stent surgery would be necessary. She gathered us all around to tell us the news. We were hurt to say the least. We didn't want to lose her or anything bad to happen. We backed up her choice to listen to her doctor, we figured she knew best and this was her body. In the back of my head I felt she should have gotten a second opinion cause she had no symptoms for this, there was no sign of it, how did this doctor get this conclusion. But she reassured us that her doctor knew what he was talking about it and she was taking it from there. My boyfriend and I took her to the hospital that morning of the surgery. She was nervous, we were nervous. After, what seemed to feel like an eternity, just 3 hours, the doctor returns to us with news. He tells us she is now in recovery but he has bad news. It turns out she really didn't need the surgery. Her test came back and there was a mistake where her results got mixed up with someone else's. They started the surgery without more test, without a second opinion. We were in outrage, his mother is old she doesn't need unnecessary surgeries.

However, due to me being born, family responsibilities and our financial situation, he was never able to buy tickets to go see them when they were on tour in America. He always worked and saved and gave everything to me an my mom. We never wanted for anything because of him and his sacrifices. But we always knew his longing to go see his favorite band. He wore an old beat up Metallica T-shirt everyday at home and played their music almost every Saturday on his day off or in the car. So, when I turned 18, me and my mom decided to plan a trip for him to go see Metallica during their US tour this year during his birthday weekend. We saved up so that he could go to a hotel and truly enjoy the weekend during the festival. During that time, mom got sick and we put our plans on hold. She passed away not too long after, just 2 months before the day of the trip. Me and my dad were devastated. Mom was our joy and losing her made us very depressed. One day, after looking through her things, I found the concert tickets that we had bought to go see Metallica with dad on his birthday. I showed dad the tickets and he broke down crying in bittersweet tears. We both went to the concert and loved it, and enjoyed it in my mom's memory.

When I was a little girl, I was very spiritual and was having a conversation with my dad about life after death. He was not a believer but told me that when he died he would come visit me to confirm it's realness if it was so. Fast forward to adulthood again, and about 1 month before he died we were talking on the phone and he stated that we have to see each other soon. He was afraid that he did not have much time left here. He needed to see his baby girl quickly. He soon passed but came to me my dreams dressed in white. He was smiling broadly, and around 30 years old. He had no eyes because what replaced them was wisp of spirit I could see clearly in them I knew he was fulfilling his promise to me when I was a little girl.

457;33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QJNMS;"I had been dating my girlfriend for 8 months when we decided that we wanted to move in together. Once we found a place of our own, I had to tell my current roommate about my intentions to move out. I gave her 7 weeks notice, which is quite a generous amount of time given the legal obligation in most states of only 30 days. She had initially received it pretty well, but left abruptly about an hour after I told her. She came back drunk in the middle of the night and proceeded to bang on my door while I was sleeping saying that we needed to talk. She then proceeded to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and how a decent person would have ""given her all the time she needed to find a new roommate."" Among the laundry list of disparaging comments was the insult that I was effectively screwing her over while she was attempting to extort several months rent out of me. After doing a bit of legal homework, I learned that she had no leverage against me and told her I was only obligated to give her 30 days notice. She blew up my phone with phone calls and text messages insulting and demeaning me and I haven't made direct contact with her since. I had since been staying at my girlfriend's house during the transition and when I first returned to my apartment in the following weeks I found all of my belongings that were in the shared common area had been ransacked and shoved into my room. The irony of this, was that my roommate said that she did not trust me with her belongings, but she felt she had the right to go through my things. Upon inspection, I found that all of my books were removed from the living room bookshelf and tossed onto my bed. Another time I returned to find that all of my kitchen belongings that I intended to pack up were thrown casually on the floor. Later the same night I got a text message from my former roommate saying that she expected me to clear out ASAP despite still being within the thirty day period of rent that I paid for my last month. The situation has escalated to a point where I no longer feel comfortable associating with this person face to face and have taken active measures to avoid her at all costs. The best part of the whole thing was that I was spending considerably less and less time at my apartment and she even admitted to seeing it coming, but she still didn't take active measures and acted out in this manner.";I told my roommate that I decided to move out of our apartment.

Approximately three months ago, my company was having an outing for its employees as a way to reward them for their hard work. They provided tickets for us to go to a baseball game. We could bring one person with us. Naturally, I decided to bring my boyfriend. I had never been to a baseball game before and this sounded like a fun thing to do, so I was really looking forward to it. My boyfriend and I sat close to the stadium, I had a hot dog in one hand a drink in another and I was chewing on the hot dog when suddenly, I noticed my face on a big screen above the stadium. Someone called my name. My boyfriend held my hand and led me to the courtyard, got down on one knee and as I held my breath and tried not to cry, he proposed to me while holding out the most precious, blue sapphire ring I'd ever seen. The entire experience felt surreal and he took my breath away at that moment. I had always seen these things happening to other people on TV, but never in a million years did I expect something this grand to happen to me, as much as I wanted it to. He mumbled a few romantic words and I could tell he was nervous. I was smiling. I was trying hard not to cry. I didn't want to ruin the moment for him. I heard him say he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He called me his best friend. His true souls mate. It couldn't get any more romantic than that. then he popped the question. Naturally, I said yes! My co-workers cheered. I started crying as he slipped the ring on my finger.

3494;3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3;Two days ago my son was harassed at football practice by some of his teammates.  He is an incredibly good player, good student, and is well-liked.  However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy.  They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.   Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.  He didn't want to turn the kids in because he felt that that would cause more problems, but he did choose to share his concerns with me -as a way to vent.  He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.  He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it.  The coach wound up looking at the security footage from the field for that day, and though he couldn't hear what was being said, he was able to determine who it was, and what was happening.  He showed the whole team the footage at practice the next day.   The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.  They were also suspended from school for their behavior.

4603;3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K3132N6YF;The event I'm choosing happened just yesterday although in reality it was more spread out through the week. My mother has been experiencing difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath for a few weeks now, and from some testing done since then doctors concluded that it was probably thyroid cancer. On Monday, she got an MRI (I think that's what it was) that gave the doctors a much clearer picture of what was going on. Anyway, they called her in for a consultation on Friday, and I went along just to provide support. After a little bit of bouncing around trying to find the right place (it was a new hospital), we were brought to a patient waiting room. A nurse took some preliminary readings and then left. Then a doctor came in to get an overview of events from my mother. I was there to add any details she'd missed, but I ended up not needing to. I mostly just sat in the corner and nodded. Anyway, before she had finished there was a knock on the door, and moments later there were about 10 people coming into the room - mostly doctors and a few nurses. They were all different specialties (radiation, chemotherapy, recovery therapy, etc.) but focused on throat and neck diseases. At this point, the room was fairly crowded so I was definitely aware of my position off in the corner. I was just trying to stay out of the way now. They ran a small camera into her nostril to check out the vocal cords. While it was in there, they asked her to do a few breathing/vocal exercises and to swallow water/applesauce. It was sort of hard to watch. It seemed like they spotted what they thought they'd seen because after a few seconds of recovery they began walking her through what they were thinking. Apparently the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs and was continuing to grow fast. I won't focus on the details here, but the plan was about two weeks of radiation as soon as possible and chemotherapy from there. The overall outlook looks very poor. Like I said, this was not information thrown at us all at once right then and there. The picture was revealed throughout the week via correspondence and examiner's reactions. Still, this was everything being laid out for sure. It was a moment of clarity I guess you could say. Then the doctors all explained how they would be involved in the process and introduced themselves and left for now - I'll end the story here because I'm getting the warning;My mother was called in for a consultation with a team of doctors regarding her recently-developed thyroid cancer.

Last week, Buddy came in from outside and appeared to be blind. His under eye lids had completely covered his eyes and he could not see. I thought he had a stroke. I called many vets and finally found one that was somewhat affordable and made an appointment. I was distraught and so very worried that he would need care that we would not be able to provide him.

Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into.

One of John's friends seemed to take a liking to Chris and was chatting her up outside on the patio.  She seemed interested in him. Pete noticed the interaction and started drinking a lot of bourbon, perhaps because he had hoped to have sex with Chris that night and saw that he had competition.

Pete had been distracted with something else and didn't notice until they had been gone for several minutes. When he figured out that Chris had left with another guy, Pete went kinda crazy.

More recently, I have been asked to work overtime on weekends, but this weekend I knew it would be more beneficial to spend time with her. We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience. What was really neat is that the zoo offered free lemonade to their guests once the temperature got above 95 degrees. Ashley must have had a gallon of lemonade that day!

We woke up very early in the morning eating breakfast and brushing out teeth. After doing this we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination. We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles.

I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.  We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a pick-nick with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream.

Several months ago, a 5-year-old patient came into the unit with some common symptoms - fever, chills, etc. but could not get a specific diagnoses. I was assigned to be the PCA working with this child during their stay. My main duties included parent and child education, what to expect, general bathing/cleaning/feeding, etc. One day, while I was alone in the room with my patient, he suddenly went into cardiac arrest. I immediately buzzed for assistance and began performing CPR. It was the first time in my career that I had done so, and although I had significant and extensive training, I had never performed CPR on a human being. As help arrived, I continued the CPR until the patient regained a normal rhythm. This event was one of the scariest moments of my life. In front of me was a 5-year-old boy whose parents were at work and had no idea that this was happening and his life was essentially in my hands at that moment. Although he survived and was eventually discharged, this event has stuck with me forever. Immediately after, I went to the bathroom and cried. I realized how physically and emotionally demanding and draining this job was. I never realized the lasting impact that a patient can have.

My other nephew was just a boy last time I saw him, now he's a senior in high school. It made me realize how time flies and how much I have missed not being near my family for the past 4 years. For my parents anniversary I had found some old pictures of both my mom and dad when they were younger, and a few from when they just started dating. I restored these pictures in Photoshop, printed them out and made a picture collage that I gave them as a gift. It made my mom emotional seeing these pictures of how young they were, and I think she was sad because life is so short. One of the pictures in particular was difficult for her, because it was one of my mom and my aunt when they were just teenagers, and my aunt has recently passed away.  My mom was so happy though with this gift, and anytime someone came over she proudly showed it to them. It made me happy I put in the effort of giving a personalized gift.

We celebrated, sang, and ate like celebrities. My parents even flew from Australia to join us. It would have been a perfect day, but one half of our family was missing. I was shocked that my in-laws would be so petty about our joint party. I was also sad for my kids because I know they would have liked them to join us.

The last time I saw her, she was asleep, and didn't wake up while I was there, but I was able to tell her that I loved her and that I hoped she had sweet dreams. It felt good to be able to do that. When we got the call, I wasn't surprised. But I still miss her, of course. She was a really interesting person. She was born to Belgian immigrants. She grew up on a farm with no electricity or running water. She had a really happy life though, and did more than she ever expected. Her funeral was really nice. A lot of people came.

This is where I would pick up my resume paper of the correct feel, weight, and texture.  I would be able to go into an office and hand in my carefully organized work. Now, the task is very simple, but very impersonal.

Apple exceeded my expectations.  They offered me $20 an hour with full benefits, regular training, and they give me unlimited support.  I am still pinching myself over my good fortune.

My sister in law had a beautiful table set with meats, cheeses and wine.  It was surprising to me that we all seemed to pick up where we left off, so to speak.

We had to take two cars.  The city we went to was Woodinville.  It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.

Though she was only halfway through her pregnancy, she was experiencing some pain and doctors couldn't figure it out. After a few weeks of dealing with it by using pain medication, her condition did not begin to improve. I was starting to get extremely worried. I could only think of my old college roommate, Kim, who went through something similar and ended up losing her child after only a few months. Though I spoke with Julie to reassure her, I remained scared at the possibility of something seriously bad happening. Then, one afternoon maybe five months ago, I received a text from her husband that nearly put me in shock. He said that she was forced into labor early and both her and the baby were on life support. This was the worst news I could have ever imagined. My jaw was on the floor. I wasn't sure what I should do. I called her husband again but he did not answer. That's when I really started to panic. So I rushed to my car and headed straight for the hospital, despite living nearly three hours away.

Why couldn't I have helped her? I just didn't know anything was wrong inside of her. Her passing showed me that I need to reach out more to others and help them if I feel like I should. I need to ask how they're doing more often or just offer to come see them and be more friendly. When I think back on our long conversations, I never remember her seeming like she needed more.

I had worked as a server in a nice family restaurant for thirteen years, after owning my own business for twenty years and retiring to go RVing.  I never thought of my serving job as really hard work, because I enjoyed the people I worked with, enjoyed the customers, was proud of the product I sold, and in general had a good time working about 25 hours per week. I retired for the second time because I am just too darned old to carry heavy trays and do my share of the cleaning and side work which each employee is expected to finish each day as part of their job. I was really touched and surprised when, on my last day of work all my coworkers gave me a small party, with gifts and cake.  My manager gave me a gift certificate for Whole Foods, and another supervisor bought me a B-B gun to scare rabbits out of my garden.  About two years before retiring I bought some land outside of town and decided to try some sustainable farming techniques and permaculture experiments.  I sold my RV and put a small home om the land.  I planned to build a greenhouse right after retirement, but I got sick and could not really do anything on my farm for two months.  I was really depressed and was about to give up.  Then one morning I got a phone call from a co-worker and friend, asking if I was going to be home that day. About an hour after the call, I looked out my front window to see a caravan of pickups and cars coming down my road.  I walked out the door to see over half my co-workers unloading building suppiles from their trucks, and picnnic supplies with a barbeque grill from various SUVs and cars.  Over the next three days every single worker in the restaurant spent hours in their off time to build me a beautiful greenhouse, a carport and a fenced in area for a garden. I never knew that friends like this existed.  I hope I have helped out when needed.  I hope I have done my share to assist my co-workers when they needed help.

While recovering from the surgery the next day something happened (I believe that a mistake was made and I was overdosed with medication) and I developed weakness on my right side.  I was treated in the hospital for the sypmptoms and after four days and transferred to a rehab hospital to regain strength and stability.  While in the rehab facility I developed a staph infection in the surgical incision which progressed into my blood stream and turned septic.  This infection made me incredibly weak and delirious.  I was transferred back to the hospital where my surgery was done and a second surgery was performed to clean the infection out of the incision and area of the surgery.

The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.

I was leased this place through a agency I thought was reputable, but I've had nothing but problems and the run-around since I moved in. We had a special event planned at the house, a post holiday gathering, and I had no means to cook for guests. Another concern became the air we breathed. I saw dust coming out of the duct work when the heating system was on. I was concerned about this because the house was so old. I bought surface lead kits hoping to ease my mind. It turned out, the duct work contained 225 ppm of lead. I knew this was way too high, so I was forced to buy air filtration units to clean the air.  The apartment was problem after problem, from the oven that took 3 weeks to be replaced, to the windows that were painted shut and couldn't be opened. AND, believe it or not, I had ivy growing out the wall, into my living room! It was like a scene from JUMANJI. I had enough of the problems here and contacted the board of health. The inspector came down the following day to check things out. He said he could do nothing about the air I was breathing, but could cite him for a number of other issues in the home.  The lead law and how it's written prevent renters from complaining. (another issue I'll have to spend some time on). Court was an interesting experience. I was glad to see someone side with me for a change. In the contract, to settle this matter, they left the issue of lead open. Now, I can go back and use this case in the future to fight for others in my situation. In short, I didn't have to pay rent for the last 3 months of the lease, and stayed through the date stated on the initial contract. I won.;An 11 month lease turned into a nightmare.

828;369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX7SHG6S;Recently I have been taking my dog to a local park that is connected to a cemetery in order to let her stretch her legs and hunt for squirrels. We are constantly pulling in there and roaming around the whole area, but we very infrequently meet other dogs and their owners while we are in the back woods area of the park. A few months ago, in the spring of this year, we were following the same course as always and we came upon a dog running loose with a collar and tags on its neck. It stopped and was friendly, then continued along the way by itself. Shortly after, me and my dog ran into the owner of the one we had just met, and he was walking another dog on a leash. We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner.

I was skeptical and had been pushing it off for a few years. The rent was just so much more in LA which was almost four times more than what I was currently paying. Not to mention the cost of living in general was so much more in California as well. It was also difficult because all of my friends and family were in New Jersey. Although there were a few musicians I was friends with, it would be almost like starting over completely since I wouldn't have my close friends anymore. However, I knew I had to try because there was so much more opportunities in LA. The music scene was much bigger in LA and there are a lot more venues that I could be booked at. My band had similar concerns but everyone except our lead guitar player, Bob, was down to go. Rob, our lead singer, didn't really have any doubts but our drummer John was difficult to convince. Anyways, we eventually got to him and decided to drive all the way from New Jersey to LA in our minivan. It was not a fun experience as everything was cramped because we had to squeeze in all of our gear. When we got to LA, everything seemed fine for the first few months. Our manager already booked us at a few venues prior to getting there and all we had to do was find a replacement for Bob. That seemed easy. Or so we thought. As we auditioned dozens of people, we quickly realized the mistake we made. The chemistry and energy Bob brought to our band was almost irreplaceable. He was an amazing backup singer and lead guitarist and none of the people we tried out came close to his level. We hastily chose someone else because we had a couple of shows coming up in a week.

When we were driving near the one big sharp turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and I thought ""this is awful fast for the SUV to drive like that"". Right about 2 secs after we saw the SUV, it lost control and rolled off the road. IT was horrible because that was my first time saw a real accident like that happened. The SUV rolled into the bushes, and we were the only two people there at the time. We parked the car off the road, called 911 and ran over.

I thought about the new levels of stress and responsibility I would have to deal with if I got the position, but I also thought about all the new projects I can be involved in and the work I can help shape. So I ultimately decided to take a chance an applied for the position. About a week after I sent in my application, I got a call from my supervisor. He told me that if I was sure about taking this position? He said he's asking because this role is known to have a high turn over rate. To be honest, I felt like he was just trying to scare me away from the job, so I told him I was serious about the job. He then said the interview for the position starts a week from that day, and I am the first one up to be interview out of a total of 15 applicants. I spent the next week practicing my answer and pitch. I made sure to remember all my accomplishments and the best way to convey them during the interview. By the day of the interview, I felt that I was ready. The interview was more intense that I expected. The questions were pointed and the complexity of the questions were high. I absolutely believe I would have bombed the interview if I didn't spend every waking moment I wasn't working or sleeping practicing my answers and my delivery.

4103;3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675V45EO7F;I have an day here in my financial record the time of debt I had from driving an car. Not one car but two, the 98 Ford Mustang the later matching my last name of the Ford expedition. AN tour with an Army unit the first time buyer cost jumped out the roof. My unknown phenomenon was credited to my version of street racing. When Ford Motor all but eliminated passenger cars from its North American lineup earlier this month to concentrate on trucks and S.U.V.s, it turned the page on a long and storied history of now-defunct but once red-hot nameplates: the Model T, the Model A, the Galaxie, the Fairlane, the Thunderbird and the Falcon, to name several. There was one conspicuous survivor: the Mustang.“Get rid of the Mustang?” asked James D. Farley Jr., Ford’s president of global markets, when I asked him this week how the Mustang had survived. “The Mustang is like Rocky: It survived the 1970s fuel crisis, the glam 1980s, the move to S.U.V.s. It’s made it through every round of cuts.”For me, the Mustang’s reprieve came as welcome news: I took my driver’s test in my mother’s 1967 turquoise Mustang notchback. On the rare occasions I was allowed to drive it, it conferred instant status and triggered unabashed envy among my high school classmates. Wall Street probably would have been just as happy to see the Mustang go the way of the Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta, current models that Ford said it would phase out and which Mr. Farley dismissed as “commodity silhouettes.” (Ford says it will continue to make passenger vehicles, but they just won’t be in the shape of today’s sedan. The Focus, for example, will survive, but as a crossover S.U.V.)That’s because in its last earnings report, Ford revealed for the first time that a relatively small number of products, including the hugely popular F-150 pickup truck series, accounted for 150 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, with profit margins in the midteens. Another group was barely profitable. By contrast, Ford said its “low performing” products lost money, with negative margins of more than 10 percent.;Around the time of this, there were very few external changes made to the Mustang. The interior was also very similar, though the clock was integrated into the stereo system, which is an easy way to tell the difference between the 1997 and 1998 Mustang.;21;358;truthful

Mom has dementia and every night as the sun goes down, she becomes agitated and restless. It becomes more difficult everyday working with her because of the progression of the disease.  I know I will get very little sleep, especially this night.  However, on the night of the full moon, for unexplained reasons, mom becomes even more restless and paces constantly. I feel bad, but I must make sure the extra code locks are locked for the outside doors, to prevent my mom from going outside at night and wander off, as she has done in the past. . During my mom's pacing episodes, she also constantly repeats the same sentence over, usually, ""I want to go home"". Even though mom is in her own home, she is unaware of her surroundings, which is more the case lately. I have to keep reassuring mom that she is at home. As the full moon gets higher in the sky, the more restless mom becomes and goes to each door trying to open the door. When the door doesn't open, mom then proceeds to each window, fortunately, most window locks are higher up or too hard for her to open. I keep asking mom to sit down and watch her favorite TV shows, I Love Lucy, but she can only sit for a few moments and then gets up again to start pacing the floor. I get out the old photo albums and try to jolt her memory to something in the past that she might remember, suddenly she looks more diligently at a picture of me as a baby where she is holding me in her arms. She stares at the picture and runs her fingers over the photo, for just a few fleeting moments, she has a look in her eyes that she remembers that time in her life. She mumbles my name and I see my opening cue to talk about when I was little. Mom then starts on the story of how I acted as a child, even though I have heard this story many times before. On these nights, the dementia that has stricken my mom seems worse, robbing her of her present memory and ability to take care of herself.

I went to work tired and worried, the stress was immeasurable.

I signed up for the morning shift and arrived a bit early.  They had started to paint the street with primer for where the design would be painted. While I waited for that to be finished, I signed in so that the city could keep track of the amount of volunteer hours that everyone preformed. I then was instructed to have some of the donuts and water that had been brought. As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road. I was told that they lived on the block. I went back to get my camera and take a few pictures of the chickens and the beginning of the artwork. I finished taking the pictures and they were ready for me to start helping. I found a paint roller and chose to start with painting the yellow rays of sunlight. It took a couple hours but it looked great. I had wanted to paint a part of the mural that I could come back and say, I did that. I decided to paint the manatee. It had already been drawn so I got the grey paint mixed and started to paint it. A young girl, who was visiting the neighborhood, asked to help paint. I directed her to where there were more paint brushes and she soon came back. It was a fun time painting the manatee. The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted. When I was finished with the outline, it looked great and everyone was really happy with it. I then took a picture of it and went home happily knowing that there was a manatee painted on that street by me.;Public art is fun and makes the neighborhood proud.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove.

3311;3OSWBBLG1FJHEI2AI1CRPC6KR16DX9;A memorable event that happened to me recently was during a trip to Anchorage, Alaska in early April. This is the earliest in the year that I have been to Alaska, and the entire trip was cold and full of snow. This was very surprising and unexpected given the weather forecast, but I had a wonderful trip anyway. It was starting to get hot at home in Ohio, so I was welcoming the cold. I traveled by myself and had many spiritual experiences in both urbanized Alaska and in the wilderness. One of the most memorable parts was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses, which are one of my favorite locations in the world. The spirit houses are traditional yupik burial grounds. Since the permafrost, even in Southcentral Alaska is very hard, burials are traditionally not performed in the ground. Rather, remains are placed on top of the earth, and a small house is hand-built around them. Each spirit house is a work of art, and they were mostly made by friends and/or family of the deceased. I can spend hours there every time I visit to wander among the houses and to learn about the people that are resting there. I am surrounded by a sense of death and peace when visiting there, and going there is always an intense, emotional, visceral experience. I felt connected to the entire earth and to the native peoples that are eternally resting there. I stayed for hours thinking about my partner, my history, and my purpose in life. It was truly a life-changing experience. I come away from Eklutna with a sense of renewed purpose every time I visit. It is a truly amazing place, and one I hope to return to someday to continue my spiritual journeys there.;The memorable event I experienced was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses north of Anchorage, Alaska.

A bad person?? Okay, let me start over from the beginning. A week ago, last Monday, my little baby boy (not so little anymore!) Henry got on the big yellow school bus for the first time ever and headed off to his very first day of Kindergarten. As I watched him go, I felt a weird mixture of feelings, one of which was relief. Relief??? I'm not supposed to feel relief!!! I'm supposed to be heartbroken and nostalgic, thinking how different things will be without him around the house. Looking at his little un-played-with toys. Missing his voice and constant questions. Thumbing through old photo albums and marveling at how it was practically just yesterday that he was taking his first steps and saying his first words. Now I'm not saying that I didn't have those feelings, of course I did. I mean, I'm not a complete psychopath. But shouldn't that be the end of the story? Am I terrible for being a little bit glad that I'm going to have a few question-free hours to breathe and decompress? Is this normal? Am I selfish? Is this a sign of a bad mother? Ugh.

4183;3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862NQK9SR;Recently, I went on a trip with my partner to Japan and Korea. We were there to see the countries but also to visit with his sister and soon to be son in law. We first stopped in Tokyo, because I was excited to go to Tokyo DisneySea. I was blown away by the cleanliness of the park, the friendlieness, and just the general kindness of the people around us. While on vacation in Japan, we went to a spa with my sister-in law and her boyfriend. The spa was completed gender separated, the girls and the boys were not able to bathe together because you were expected to go into the hot spring nude. I was struck by the thought that I would have to be in front of my sister in law naked and how many other women. I worried about my body, my hair, my fat the entire train ride up into the mountains. But once, we got there, and I was in my robe waiting to go into the water, I stopped caring. I was quick to adjust and accept that was what was going to happen. The first time I went in I thought it was like a soak that you would do in a hot tub. I was wrong, very wrong. It was more like a spa experience where you are expected to do temperature treatments in the water. Going back and forth between hot and cold while you clean/scrub your body. I felt great afterward, my skin was so soft. I quickly became comfortable with my body and it wasn’t an issue. I was self-conscious but accepted that my body is my body and it isn’t going to change in the next hour. It was an emotional experience because during that time that my sister in law and I were in the water we got to talk and I thought really get to know one another. We hadn’t seen each other much since we were living in different countries and it was a great experience to spend together.

4369;3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540PCF1H;Back in April of 2019 I went on a trip down to my college to visit some of my friends that I went there with. I was kicked out of that college at the end of the Fall 2018 semester, and had been missing them for a good few months. At first all went well, and we hit it off with some ordered pizza and video games. Things got strange mid-way through, however, and the student that I was visiting started acting strange. He began to get uncomfortably close, and started making inappropriate gestures and comments. These gestures included kissing my hand, cuddling me unprompted, and saying strange things about me and my body. I spent that entire night trying to distract myself from the situation, knowing that I wouldn't be able to go home until morning. I could barely sleep that night, and spent most of that night talking to one of my online friends to try to keep myself calm. She agreed that the situation was strange, and that I was right to feel the way I did. When the morning came I covertly called in my ride home, pretending to be asleep until she would arrive. The student didn't wake up until late, so I was able to slip out of the dormitory building undetected with all of my belongings packed. The ride home was awkward, and I made no attempt to tell my ride why I called her in so early in the morning. I was just happy to be out of the situation, despite deep down feeling conflicted and sad. After I got home from the ordeal I laid down for a bit, and thought about the situation thoroughly, trying to find something to make sense of it all. For that entire day I ghosted the student, not answering any of his messages or making any attempt to reach out to him over the situation. I felt filthy, and to say that I was depressed for that period was an understatement. When I finally did gather up the courage to tell him how I felt, I had to force the confrontation out of myself.  He apologized, and said that he wouldn't do it again. He said that he agreed he felt his actions were wrong, and in the heat of the moment. However, that was not the end of his behavior in that way, and I spent more months talking to him and subjecting myself to his treatment. That event is the central event that made me question whether or not he was really my friend, and whether he considered me an object instead of a person.

After the class we all had a chance to talk and converse what was shared. My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us.

Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student. One can also see love between animals that care for their young or their mate. Love appears in many forms indeed. My feeling is that it's best to express rather to repress ones love.

Over in the night at a truck stop, my husband's trailer was robbed of some of the contents, which was boxes of frozen chicken. Not all was taken but a few boxes were. The truck stop, of course had no cameras, and he ended up having to file a police report and file an insurance claim. Since there was an insurance claim, my husband had to kept the load in his trailer until all investigation was over. With that being said, this investigation ended up taking over 2 months to resolve. First, it was trying to get an insurance claim person to look at the remaining contents in the trailer to see if they were still viable and can be sold off. Then, there was a back and forth for a moment, trying to determine if the insurance even covered frozen chicken. During these 2 months, still, my husband was not able to work because there was a load still on his truck. We blew through our bank accounts and our savings trying to maintain our bills and a household of 5. This put such a strain on our household and bank accounts. We have never experienced anything remotely close to this in our lives. To put an end to this story, after about 2 months, he was able to unload the contents in his trailer, however, by that time, we did not have any more money to maintain the daily expenses of operating a truck and had to give it up.;My family suffered when my husband's work truck contents was stolen out of the trailer.

3632;3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ;I have a disability. I cannot hear ever since I was a baby. I grew up with difficulties because I could not be taught like other kids in school. I had to attend a special needs school where I was taught through sign language. Fortunately, I can speak, so responding in school wasn't a problem. The biggest problem for me is not being able to have a normal social life. Most of the people I know, including my friends and family don't have the same problem so it's not easy for them to adapt to me when I'm around. It kills me when I see them laughing at a joke that I did not hear. Whenever I am with other people, I cannot help but feel inferior. I recently talked about it with one of my friends and she told that they try to make sure that I am included but sometimes involuntarily end up forgetting that some one with special needs is around. Moreover, having this disability as a woman is very hard. Other than not having a meaningful social life, my dating life has been hell. I can hardly ever connect with anyone. For someone to date me, they would need to be fluent in sign language and willing to use it all the time to talk to me. It's also worth noting that it's hard to express emotions through sign language so it's hard for me to have an emotional connection with a partner. Most of my partners just end up leaving because my life situation is too much for them to endure.;As a woman with a disability who uses a wheelchair, I am often excluded due to accessibility issues even when it involves people who are supposedly my friends.;16;266;deceptive
1477;3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYOUA291;For years I played bass in a a fairly popular band that toured around the world but stopped  a few years ago. This last July the band reformed and traveled to Bogota, Colombia to play a show. It was fun and a bit surreal to reunite and work with the other members after all the time off. It was also pretty humorous to see how quickly we all settled in to our old behaviors. Traveling as a group can be stressful especially when you have to transport instruments that the TSA views with suspicion and attempts to disassemble, which is what happened to me. Thankfully I was able to get everything working for the concert.  We had a full day in Bogota before the show, which we spent hanging out with a promoter with whom we had worked before on a previous trip. He took us to local restaurants and record stores which we never would have stumbled on by ourselves. Then that evening there was a party at a record store in kind of a hipster area of town. After that we headed to a small jazz club where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing. It was a small cafe with a prominently displayed triptych of chairman Mao. There are very good painters in Bogota and there are very elaborate murals to be seen everywhere and even the graffiti approaches high art. The show was a double bill with another band and took place in a very large 5000 seat auditorium, even though neither band had the capacity to draw that many people. Even though the whole organization was very professionally run, sound check seemed to last forever and resulted in my not being able to have lunch with an old friend who I hadn't seen for years. But the concert itself went well there was a good showing on the ground floor seats, but the balconies remained unused. Afterwards I was able to meet up with my friend and go out for some drinks. The day after the show was spent in the studio collaborating with the band with whom we had shared the bill, and felt like equal parts work and social occasion. Some friends of the other band who are foodie types, prepared a meal for everyone, and there was plenty of beer and wine and general frivolity. Our last day in Bogota was open so the guitarist and keyboardist and I went to the National museum, which is a sprawling, long and narrow building with lots of interactive exhibits on everything about Colombian culture past and present.  Afterwards we had lunch at a Peruvian restaurant which, ironically was some of the best food we had in Colombia. That was followed by lots of walking through flea markets and street fairs that spring up during the weekend. Then it was time to make our way to the airport for our red eye flight back to New York.;I reunited with a band i used to play in.

Okay, you know how in movies someone will stub their toe and knock open a hidden wall panel? Then they check the wall panel and, gosh darn it, there's the map to old man Henderson's treasure? That wall panel was my life five months back. The stubbed toe? Well that was my financial situation.Do you know what a balloon payment is? Apparently it's when your mortgage payment shoots up suddenly. I didn't know that was a thing. My bank account didn't know either. Now, normally I would have just worked overtime, picked up an extra shift, something like that. But thanks to the car accident and the broken legs, that wasn't really an option. I looked through every option that WAS an option, poured through them really but between the medical bills, the sudden mortgage bump and the price to fix the vehicle... At the end of the day I only had one choice left to me, file for bankruptcy.Ouch, right? When I first considered it, my mind jumped right to the negative. 'What will my family think?' 'People are going to mock me.' That sort of stuff. You hear about corporations having to go through it all the time, but when it's you... Well, when it's was ME, that was a whole other world. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to suffer all the looks and the glances and the questions about rather that meant I was going to be homeless now or if I needed money for food. Just like the stubbed toe though, I didn't really get a choice in the matter. It's kind of funny though, because looking back on it, it really wasn't that bad. I got my life back under control and the embarrassment, light as it was, only hardened my resolve to get control back in my own hands. It's been five months since I kicked open that wall and not only have I found Mr. Henderson's metaphorical map, I've dug up his metaphorical treasure, sold it off on the metaphorical market and invested that money in my metaphorical savings account. I've never felt more in control or competent when managing my finances.;My husband and I filed for bankruptcy a few months back.

It took months to get a cardiologist to order the test, for some reason. They seemed to test me for everything else first. I eventually went to a heart hospital and had a test called a tilt table test. In this test they strap you to a table, with a pillow behind your head. You lie down for a while, and then they tip up the table to an angle less than 90 degrees. For about half an hour you just stand still and everyone waits to see if you are going to have symptoms. I didn't think I was going to have any, and the test was almost over. When I had finally decided I was never going to faint, I did. The nurse asked me how much I remembered. I said, ""I remember saying I feel weird."" She replied, ""Wow."" So I have no idea how many things I must have missed between passing out and coming to. I was so grateful that I had proven this condition to the medical community that I was laughing and joking around with the four people who had been monitoring me.

Sometimes you don't know how much you've missed someone until you see them again. The reason for this family reunion was the wedding of my beautiful cousin. The wedding was actually quite small. But many of the guests stayed at our cousin's house so the place was cramped. Being the thoughtful person she is, our cousin booked us a stay at a local motel. At first, my family and I were wary of staying at motels. But we soon found out that the motel she booked was more of a family inn — complete with a wonderful complimentary breakfast. The day of the wedding was hectic, as you could imagine. The bride was running everywhere — followed by 3 or 4 of her bridesmaids and female relatives. The groom seemed relaxed (maybe he was good at hiding his emotions). The actual ceremony went off without a hitch. And the reception featured a wonderful buffet that I can see and smell. Overall, the trip was an overwhelming success. We got to enjoy the cool weather of San Francisco while bonding with family members we've known for a while. We even met a few of our relatives for the first time! I hope to travel more with my family in the near future.;I went to a family wedding in San Francisco.

2004;3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGU4UPOX;Dear Diary, it was a very hard two months after the theft of my husband's power tools out of his work truck.  He lost his miter saws, makita drills, and a lot of expensive woodworking chisels and levelers.  Fortunately, one of the neighbor's houses nearby had one of those smart doorbells and had video surveillance footage of the thief.  We called the police immediately afterwards and they were able to start on the theft with a decent lead.  The camera caught the thief's license plate too.  Unfortunately, my husband had a job lined up that we were counting on to help us pay for our bills, and he was not able to keep the job because all of his work tools were stolen from the trailer.  The police caught the thief within a week, but by then most of my husband's tools were gone.  We have the option of trying to sue the thief and claim some money in damages and lost wages, but we are not sure if it is even worth pursuing that, as the thief does not appear to be worth much money.  The hard part about this is because of our large family, we do not have much savings, and the two months that my husband was out of work, depleted all of our savings, and we were forced to sell our truck.  It was a tough decision, but we had no choice.  My husband will hopefully be able to buy a new truck if we get money from the thief.  While the two months were very challenging, surprisingly the event brought us closer together as a family.  Without his tools and not being able to work, my husband spent the last two month mainly at home with the kids.  He said to me last night, that while the loss of his tools and financial hardships were stressful and challenging, he has found the last two months to be enjoyable because of the extra time he was able to spend with our children.

He had gotten a new job, and I decided the rainy city would be a good place for me to start my own career . The first week we moved into our small one bedroom apartment everything was great. My boyfriend loved his job, we were finally finished unpacking, and a company called me back about an interview. But reality settled in pretty quickly one day when I realized: I had made this move for the benefit of my boyfriend and not myself. He had friends in Seattle whether or not  it be coworkers at his job, or cool people he meet through work. As for me, I had no friends or family.

I went to the doctor and was prescribed Sertraline. The medication helped with the anxiety immediately. I continued on the course prescribed by my doctor: continue taking the Sertraline and increase the dose at regular weekly intervals. I began taking the smallest dose, 25 milligrams. In the following weeks I upped the dose to 50mg, then 100mg, then 150mg. After several days on the 150mg dose, I began feeling somewhat ill with stomach problems and a bit of increased anxiety. I was informed enough to know that these were symptoms of a potentially dangerous condition known as seratonin syndrome which is caused by elevated levels of seratonin in one's system. I immediately reduced my dosage of the Sertraline to 100mg. Knowing that I had another follow-up appointment with my doctor several days later I assumed that my seratonin levels would drop by the time of the appointment and then we could discuss weaning myself off of the Sertraline. In the time leading up to the appointment my seratonin levels continued to spike though, and while the negative symptoms were increasing (hyperactivity, shakiness, muscle tremors) the spike also triggered a breakthrough in my depression that was so powerful I can only equate it to what one might call a ""spiritual"" awakening.

For the past year I've been trying out various Buddhist practices - particularly a lot of different meditation techniques. Sitting meditation can cause a lot of pain to arise in the body for me, and instead of working through that like I should, I've started to do a lot of walking meditation instead. This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly.

As my friends family was my family's family friend.           I was working five days a week and go to Aunts house in the weekend. And it was a long routine of about an year.            At this point o time one fine day when i went there I saw him,was quiet surprised as i was not familiar with that face or personality. But i had caught a sight of ""love at first sight""            As he was a impressive person with warm attitudes.            We spend weekend together with my friend ,We exchanged out thoughts , feelings , and found that our wavelengths sinks so well.

We started sharing our personal thoughts about the views of life,The point of view where we are more attached or detached .

The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every.

Before the show started, a group of drunk middle aged people wearing ""fun hats"" came in and asked for discounts on tickets. My friend who was producing the show foresaw them becoming a problem, and warned them that they had to remain respectful and not disrupt the show. Once the show started, they started getting loud, heckling the comedians, have loud conversations amongst themselves, and interrupting the show over and over. My friends on stage were struggling to keep the show going and not lose the audience by being too hard on them. I was finally fed up and yelled out for them to shut up. This caused a chain reaction where other frustrated audience members started yelling at them, confrontations between other audience members and them, some of the other comedians trying to hget them to leave and then finally the show runner came to ask them to leave. The main ringleader was wearing a pirate hat and refused to go after his friends did. He would start feigning falling over into the chairs when my friend touched his arm, and getting in front of the stage and shouting so that no one could move on.

On my way there,  I saw a sign for a blood donation drive that was occurring that day. They desperately needed people to offer their blood. On impulse I decided to go in and donate. I was a first time blood donor so the volunteers and nurses put me through a screening process and gave me a questionnaire. I passed the screening and proceeded to donate my blood. The process itself had no complications and took about 15 minutes. Afterwards I sat at a table where there were cookies and apple juice. I felt fine at first but within a few minutes I started to feel dizzy. All of a sudden, I keeled over and went into a dream world.

I was put on IVs for a couple of hours.

4805;3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DKTE41Q;I read a book about a woman's cells who have greatly shaped science, medicine, and vaccines. She had cervical cancer in her 30's and a part of her tumor was taken to see if the cells could be kept alive in culture. It resulted that her cells not only stayed alive, they thrived and reproduced very easily. Her cells are now considered immortal. However, what really touched me emotionally and what was most memorable was reading about how she got cervical cancer. She got cervical cancer due to being exposed to different strains of HPV by her husband numerous times, a fact which was only discovered decades later. Due to that finding, a vaccine was formulated to reduce the risk of cervical cancer in women. Reading that immediately prompted me to read more about the HPV vaccine and it's dosage requirements and effectiveness. I remembered that I had only had one dosage so far. As such, reading about this woman who died as a result of being infected by her husband really made me angry at the fact that there was no way for her to have known this could have happened to her. To me, reading about this woman's life validated the need for me to get my second and third dose of the vaccine although I had gotten the first dose more than 2 years ago. She suffered immensely in the last few months of her life and her family also suffered her loss due to something that in this day and age is preventable. Reading about her story opened my eyes about not just cancer, but HPV and the importance of being vaccinated against it. Due to this book I sought out extra medical information that further educated me about the matter and motivated me to contact my health care provider. It also prompted me to have a conversation with my siblings about it.

Thankfully, my husband was home as I was not able to move the bed off of me myself. I screamed for him to come into the room and he quickly moved the heavy bar off of me. Initially, there was a good amount of pain however, thankfully, it seemed as if my arm wasn't broken. After a day or two a huge bruise formed which covered half of my upper arm. The bruise was huge but, at that point it wasn't as painful as it looked. I cared for arm by icing for the first week. After about the first week a hematoma started to form. Within 3 days it was larger than the size of a baseball. At that point it was very painful - it felt as if there was nerve damage. The pain increased as the size increased. I went to the Emergency Room twice during that period of time. Xrays, ultrasound and an MRI were done to rule out a break, blood pooling or infection. Everything checked out and I was told that it would take time for the hematoma to dissolve and patience would be needed. A third trip to the ER in July included being admitted to the hospital for observation. At that point an infection needed to be ruled out. Surgery was being talked about to drain the blood. In the end the surgeon decided that it wasn't absolutely necessary to drain it but he could do it if I decided that this was what I wanted. I decided to pass on the surgery and to continue to allow it to naturally dissipate. As it was very painful, I continued to ice it and wrap it with an Ace bandage.

I had beer with my steak. She had wine with her sirloin. The bill was expensive. Another restaurant we went to was a chicken place. I got a full chicken to eat. She got a half chicken to eat.

2177;3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6FQGWQ;"About three months ago I started going to see a therapist. I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me. Easily the most memorable experience that I've had this year.";I started speaking to a therapist about issues that have haunted and weighed me down for years. I had never been able to talk about things fully with anybody without judgement before. It was an experience that I will never forget.;23;384;truthful
1647;3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWZQ29N2;I bought my wedding dress two months ago! It was an amazing experience! When I was planning my wedding dress shopping trip, I invited my mom, sister, maid of honor, future mother-in-law, and future sister-in-law, because I wanted them to share in the experience. We made two appointments in a town near my home town for a Saturday, but there was one store that I wanted to visit that was about an hour away. So, my mom and I made a secret plan to visit the far away store, just to be sure that my dress wasn't there, but I thought that since it would be my first time trying on dresses, there would be no way that I would find my dress without the rest of my party! Well, I was wrong! My mom and I walked into the bridal salon, and while we were waiting for the bridal consultant, we both locked eyes on a dress at the same time. We decided that I should try on that dress first, because it was absolutely beautiful. When our bridal consultant came up to us, we picked a few other dresses that matched my style, but I tried on the original dress first. Even though it was beautiful, I wasn't sure if it was the one for me, so I kept trying on more. After about a dozen dresses, I tried on another dress that was exactly what I had pictured myself getting married in...but I couldn't stop thinking about the first dress! So, I tried on the first dress again, this time with a veil, and my mom and I both knew--that was the one. The best part of the story comes next, though! At this bridal salon, they allow the first bride who purchases a dress to give it a name (like a human name), and my dress had never been purchased before. So, I got to name my dress after my maternal grandmother, who died fourteen years ago, and who my mom and I miss very much. We both cried! Then, the next day, the rest of my initial wedding dress crew came back with me so they could see the dress. We all cried and drank champagne, and it was one the best experiences I've ever had!;I bought a wedding dress this summer with my mom.

Everything culminated to this one day. It was possibly one of the happiest moments of my life, finally meeting him. My wife and I were overcome with joy. It was a long and hard pregnancy. There were many problems and scares, but we made it out in the end. Looking into my sons eyes and hearing his voice for the first time was absolutely astounding.

Over the years I've loaned them quite a bit of money (which they never repay) when I've been optimistic that they're straightening out their lives and need help to move forward.  This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.  He asked me if he could borrow $250 which he'd repay when he got a check in the mail in a few days and I foolishly agreed.  The check did come and he called me and said he was coming right over with the money and asked if he could do some laundry.  I haven't seen him since.  He took the money and paid for some more nights in the motel room and lots of vodka.  I was taking care of his dog who howled all day and night with separation anxiety.  I've been worried and scared for my son's health and safety for a long time but after this incident, that's changed into anger and fear for my own safety from people who absolutely put alcohol ahead of everything in life.

Being far away from our best friends is hard but one day after this whirlwind military lifestyle, we will be able to add roots.  We were suppose to go to their house this year because we alternate locations but instead they came to us since the hubby is on a crazy work schedule.   The day started out moggy and hot, that should have been our first sign that we were in for an adventure.  We pack all 8 kids, the coolers, the trailer with our camping gear and lots of sunscreen and bug spray.  The GPS says it will take 4 hours to drive to the river.  Boys are in one vehicle, girls are in the other.  We take our time on the drive because tonight will just be s'mores and a bonfire.  We finally make it to our campground around 3:00pm.  We unpack the vehicles and trailer so we can get the two tents up before dark.  After an hour, we have the tents up and have started setting up chairs, fire pit, coolers, food, and horseshoes.  Around 6pm, we start cooking hotdogs and just hang out for the night.  We know that we will have to be up by 9am to get ready for the river.

He was diagnosis with pulmonary lung disease back 2018 but probably had this disease long before that time.  He was a vibrant man considering his age of being 80.  He lived on a farm raising cattle and always took care of his chores until he no longer could. My husband and brother-in-law had to take over the family farm. Eventually the situation started taking a hold on the families since we all lived an hour away. His prognosis wasn't good but he kept persevering until he could no longer take care of himself or the farm. He did not want to go into a home so we called hospice and they helped a couple times a week with the rest of us helping the other days. Towards the end my Father-in-Law had to use an oxygen tank. I noticed every time I seen him he kept loosing weight. He had so much fluid on his lungs that he was no longer hungry. He was wasting away to nothing. We finally had hospice bring a bed into his house and place it in the living room. He no longer had energy to walk to his bedroom. I knew the end was near. We took turns with staying over night at his house as he was now in need of 24 hour care. The night that me and my husband were staying with him he wanted us to say a prayer together.  After that he said he loved us and was really tired. We told him we loved him and to get some rest.  At about 1 in the morning we heard a noise and we both got up. We went to the living room to see my Father-in-Law coughing, chocking, and having a hard time breathing.  He eventually fell back to sleep.

1703;3DH6GAKTYZB9HOXGFFNQZIWWHPAYZZ;At the beginning of spring this year, my husband and I made a decision to sell our house. It was the house we closed on the week before we got married -- it's the house we brought our son home from the hospital. We had so many mixed emotions about putting the house on the market. We wanted to move to a different neighborhood, back to the neighborhood we both lived in when we met, so it wasn't a sad occasion but I did not anticipate the bittersweet emotions. I did not realize how strong my emotional ties were to this house. Within the first few days of the house being on the market we got a full-price offer from a fellow, who by all accounts, walked into the house and absolutely fell in love with the place. I was so relieved that we'd found someone who appreciated the house for what it was (modest, no frills, mid-century ranch with a decent finished basement). After we'd gone under contract, we had to scramble to try to find a new place before closing. We knew the general area where we wanted to live but nothing was on the market that checked all the boxes and was within our price range. Then, on Friday afternoon while I was out of town, my realtor called and said she had a house that she thought we'd want to see. I couldn't go but my husband and my son went with her to check it out. It was perfect. They loved it -- they FaceTime'd me while they were walking through it and I loved it. We knew it would move quickly (given the nature of the market and the quality of the house) but I was out of town for the whole weekend and we hadn't taken any steps to secure financing. So that Monday, as soon as the mortgage office opened, we had a call into a mortgage lender who was able to approve us for the loan. Our agent worked out the contract details and submitted our offer only to find out that another full-price offer had been submitted hours earlier. We were crestfallen because we felt certain that, with two identical offers, the owners would choose the one that came in first.

Of course I had friends my age, but “they couldn’t live with me,” my mother repeatedly told me after my crying sessions when they left. I wanted someone to mess with and blame things on. If I took the last cookie off the plate, I couldn’t blame anyone. It was clearly me. I mean, I loved being spoiled by both of my parents, but my dad wouldn’t want to sit down and have tea parties with me and my stuffed animals, and my mother got tired of it after an hour or so. So where did that leave me? Alone with Mr. Penguin with his overstuffed white belly, and my favorite pink bear with the bright yellow hat that I can’t remember the name of now. It was hot. Well maybe it wasn’t, but that’s how I felt. I tried to hide the tears that were about to come down by smiling. That always worked. “Cool,” I said. My dad could see that there was some subliminal message that I wasn’t telling him, but he went along with it. I stared into the baby’s big brown eyes, complemented by long eyelashes I envied. He looked back at me and smiled. “Hi Legend, I’m your big sister.” It was a regular day after school, but I decided to go over my dads for a little while before I went home. My dad picked me up from Broad & Olney and on the ride to his house, he blasted some good ole hip hip in his oversized truck. When we reached a parking spot, he stopped me. “Symone, I got a surprise for you.” “What is it,” I said eagerly.;Brother who live far away from the family come to meet his family, giving surprise and happy moment for every one in the home.Surprise to every one living in the home;24;311;truthful

The one he had was not really cutting it for our finances, and money was really tight. We found that we were spending more money each month than we were earning. It was a very stressful time for us. My husband found a great job that paid almost three times his previous salary. He also got a signing bonus that allowed us to put down a down payment for a larger vehicle. We had to take two cars to get our whole family somewhere, and now we can all fit in our (new to us) van! We bought a 2012 Honda Odyssey and the color is a gorgeous deep red. We got a really good deal on it, and while I never really wanted a minivan, I'm glad that everyone can finally fit in one car. I was surprised how much I loved it! We were also able to catch up on our electricity and gas bills. We weren't behind a whole bunch but it was refreshing to finally be able to reach a balance of zero!

We go there to watch hockey games, to hang out with our friends that have moved there, and to drink craft beer, as this is a hobby of ours. I am the planner, and am comfortable planning things for us because my boyfriend doesn't care about what we do one way or another. This year I let him know I was planning for us to visit a total 19 different breweries and worked out when could do each thing I wanted. One of the things we had to figure out when we would be hitting up all the breweries I wanted to visit in Boulder. We had to plan this carefully because some days were just out of the question - there were two days we needed to be in Denver for because we would be attending hockey games, and we wanted to be in Denver on the last day we were leaving instead of going to the airport from Boulder. In the end, everything worked out. We went to Boulder the day we got into town. We got to see his friend that moved up there. I got to spend some one-on-one time at brunch with my friend while my boyfriend slept in at the hotel. We got to see hockey games. We visited a cat cafe on our final day in town and brought them some toys that I had ordered and shipped to an Amazon Locker. My boyfriend got some advice from brewers, as he was seeking to brew his own beer. We even got to visit some places that weren't on the list because I didn't schedule any restaurants for us to visit while we were there. Every day was rewarding because we had an itinerary, a purpose for visiting each brewery, and because I focused on location and hours of operation of each of those places and planned accordingly. The only thing we didn't get to do - again - was visit the Denver Mint. He had been wanting to go since the first year we went. Maybe next year.;My boyfriend and I made our third trip to Denver.

I was excited and nervous because it seemed like we were spending a lot of money to buy materials and hire a contractor.  There are many parts of our home that need work but we decided on the master bathroom.  I had picked out a contractor who had done a small job for me 2 years ago but I really didn't know him well.  He didn't give me much guidance about what I needed to do to prepare for the project so all I did was pick out some tile for the wall.  I think he assumed that I knew more than I know (I tend to fool people like this sometimes :) ) so I felt kind of stupid when he was asking me questions.  It turned out that he had similar taste in terms of design and he was able to give me some great advice.  He and his helper were easy to be around and I feel like I made a new friend.  The bathroom is beautiful but this isn't where the story ends.  Meeting him kind of flipped my  world on its axis.  I found myself energized to not only see the house differently but to look at myself differently.  It's like I woke up from a funk and have started paying attention to myself and my surroundings.  I painted the front of the house and replaced the house numbers.  I bought some plants to add some color.  I renewed my  gym membership and started going regularly.  I polish my nails now!

927;37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0VKRD6A;Since separating from her mother in 2014 my relationship with my daughter, has been nearly nonexistent. It was strained prior to that  but devolved even more so at that point. She was sixteen at the time and is twenty two now.  Initially I would see her every couple of weeks for lunch and then once a month or so. After not being able to make a lunch date in late 2015 we have not physically seen each other only communicating by short, usually one (my) sided text messages. In January of 2018 I sent her a text apologizing for  being a bad father and asking her forgiveness I certainly had not been an ideal father, although her mother was not an ideal role model herself. I also offered to send her a walking stick I had made for her. I make a very few of them every year for significant people in my life. Each one is unique and cut from trees native to the area where I am at the time. This was a very nice sassafras stick with a spiral pattern from a honeysuckle vine having grown around it. It takes a few months for each stick, two to three for it to dry, a couple of weeks for whittling the bark and other designs and then two to three weeks for the oiling and varnishing.  She declined the stick and also did not accept my apology, replying back just how bad I had been. About three weeks ago I got a text from her late in the evening asking if I still did some woodworking and if I still had the stick I made for her. I replied that I did and would be happy to send it to her. She said she would be happy to have it., I found a long enough box and shipped it to her. She received the stick two weeks ago and truly liked and appreciated it. Our relationship definitely seems to be on the mend and we are communicating more, although I am very, very careful to take this slowly.

561;34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48WI1;I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.;I went to Ubeda in the south of Spain for my best friend's wedding.

We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition.  Finally, the problem got so severe that she had a major back spasm that would not relent.  As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER.  There, they verified it was a back spasm related to her herniated disc.  It was an emotionally difficult time for us all.  She was under great pain, so much that she could not speak.  I had to maintain my stress level, as I have high blood pressure, and call to get her treated.  Then, we were told that she would STILL have to go to her PCP to get treatment, but at least they gave her enough pain meds to get her there.  Over the weeks that would follow, there would be many, many consultation visits, scans, and lab works.  It was not easy, but they did finally get her on good meds, a back shot, and therapy...back at the ER that would not allowed to treat us at the start without all of this run around.

My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game but i surprised him with tickets anyways.  This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey and he had been watching the Blues his whole life and they have never won it.  I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it.  It was a stressful start of the game but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission and that mission was to bring the Stanley cup to our town for the first time ever.  I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored like he was starting to believe we might actually do it.  I was also freaking out inside because i knew we had been close before but always got let down and anything can happen in sports. Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst.

Most recently was about three months ago. Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere. So now I found myself scrambling trying to find some kind of ""fix this mess"" workaround all the while mentally kicking myself for being such a slacker in the first place. After about 50 phones calls to every friend and FOF (friend of friend) in very high (and a few low) places, I learned quite a lot about emission testing. For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day.

Only problem was it was lasting only 5-10 minutes when my usual stuff would last hours. So i kept packing and packing my bowl with this weird substance of weed or as i look back now probably the legal K2 Stuff thats horrible for you and all night just kept packing it. halfway through the bag I noticed i started feeling very weird.. I took off my clothes and took a cold shower but that was no help. I started laying on the floor gasping for air trying to breath but couldn't grab enough oxygen. My girl took me to the hospital that day and it was just an 'anxiety attack' but i bought the stuff to help with the anxiety. how could it have made it worse. since then i have been dealing with severe anxiety.;I smoked weed to try to deal with anxiety but got sold some bad stuff. ended up in the hospital and have been dealing with panic attacks since then.;21;381;truthful

Now obviously, this can often come at odds with family and friend matters, it becomes increasingly difficult to have a personal life with people other than co-workers. Anyways, so yet again I was seeing some issues regarding my business schedule and how I could make time for family. I felt really bad, prior to working for this company my niece and I were extremely close. In fact, I practically raised her myself when her parents were not around to handle matters (things were pretty tight with them so they had to work a lot). I finally had made up my mind and firmly resolved I could not miss this. So I spoke with some of my co-workers and really, REALLY had to twist their arms about it. I didn't want to bring it up with upper-management because I knew they would react with cold disregard. In this company, your company is your personal life and if you aren't cut out for this, the door is right there. So I convinced my co-workers to cover this one project for me, it was not easy. I had to really sweeten the deal, I told each of them I would cover twice as many projects for them (if and when they needed it). I added in that whatever projected time off they had, I would take a lot of the paper work-load off their hands for them (we never REALLY get a vacation). My niece was overjoyed to see me and honestly, just that look on her face would've been worth 5X what I offered my coworkers. We celebrated not just that weekend but the following week as well. That girl is my life, I'll never be able to pass up an opportunity to be in her life again.

The first day we went sightseeing and we went to the Eiffel Tower.  We had to pay just to go to the top, which was irritating, but it was worth it once we got there.

Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends. I also got to see her family for the first time in a while which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party, it was only family members and that made me feel quite warm. It also was the first time I got to see my friends new house.

We had such a fun time performing karaoke on stage with several people like we were in a karaoke band. It was an all out concert experience with complex lighting, smoke machine, and a cheering crowd. We all drank a bit too much throughout the night that by the end of the party I was pretty trashed and so were my buddies. As the party dwindled down and some people had left the bar, I decided to call an Uber just to get home safely. While waiting for the Uber my friend Dan had called my cell phone to let me know that he was at the police precinct a few blocks down from the bar and needed my help. He explained that he had been pulled over by an unmarked police car at a stop sign. The officer said he smelled of alcohol so he needed to take a field sobriety test, which he failed and was immediately arrested. So Dan asked if I could bail him out and wanted me to pick him up from the precinct when they released him in a few hours. However, there was a problem because I had left my car at the bar parking lot since I was also drunk. Anyway, I promised him I'd be there to bail him out and take him home. I told the Uber driver to take me to an ATM where I took out $200 for Dan's bail, then immediately driven to the precinct to pay it. While waiting for him, I slept in a chair in a waiting area where he was released to me 4hours later. I called an Uber driver to pick us up and bring us to my apartment so we could get some rest. Later that night after we had sobered up, we called another Uber that brought Dan and I to a car lot because his car had been towed after his arrest. We paid for his car to be released.

3077;3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SU6X72A;I've been working on this project at work for about a year, and three months ago we finally soft launched it. I work for a transit company, and we provide the only real mass transit in my city. Recently we launched an exciting new BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) line. This route has been in planning for years, and ever since I started working here I've been involved with planning, tracking, outreach, etc. It was exciting to launch it, we had the news here, tons of people, 200 volunteers from the city, and all sorts of other things. We had live bands playing at some of the stops, a DJ at the transit center, and a ribbon cutting at city hall. The exciting part about this line is that it uses a fleet of full electric vehicles, they emit almost no pollutants, and are extremely quiet. There were some hiccups. Ridership was much higher than we anticipated, so the buses were going much slower than intended. Usually the buses will run every 10 minutes, the whole line should take about an hour and a half to complete a full round trip. The line runs North to South, and we were pushing 35-45 minute wait times. The buses were so packed that we eventually had to turn people away if it was too full. After the launch we received some complaints due to timing issues. We fixed those by adding more buses to the routes. Another complaint we had was that bus stations (these are center lane stations) were causing congestion, so we improved traffic light switches for bus only lanes, to minimize the time at each stop. The city was excited and came out in force, and it made all the hard work worth it. I feel like we dropped the ball in some places, but man we did our best, and I'm so proud of my team and myself. We did some fun activities that entire week, and we have some other fun stuff in the works.

I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office.

We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior.

He had been taking a few steps here and there, walking with the assistance of us or the couch, but never just standing up on his own and walking! I was so excited! Maybe to excited because we were so loud yelling ""he's walking, o my goodness,"" that he fell shortly after. My husband had just went into the garage. He ran in the house, but had missed his first steps. He was sad that he missed it. We had him walk again for his Dad and so we could get it on video to send to our family.

She was essentially a second mom to me and we were extremely close. 2 weeks ago, though, she suddenly died. It was completely unexpected. She wasn't sick, wasn't showing any signs of getting sick, she was how she always was. My dad went to her house to take over some food he made, and found her dead in bed. She died in her sleep. When I was told the news, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know how to react. I knew it was going to happen, eventually, but not so unexpectedly. I didn't cry at first due to the shock. It wasn't until a few days later when I realized that those few days was the longest amount of time I had gone without seeing her in my entire life, that I realized she was gone. That is when I got emotional and kind of broken down. It was hard to deal with, and it still is. Its only been two weeks, but it feels like its been months.

He had booked a flight from his hometown to a city near me. I drove about 3 hours to pick him up at that cities airport. It was the first time I had met him and seen him in real life so I was really looking forward to it. He made me feel good and cared for for so many years before we actually met.

I got to visit all sorts of new places and we did a lot of fun things together. I remember that being with him and at his place, was the best that I had ever slept in many months. It was like he and I belonged together, and for once I felt like I was with someone who could handle things and didn't need me to do it all. It was the best I had felt in my life in a really long time. He made me feel adored and loved. He made me feel really special and talked in ways about the two of us that no one even did before.

I learned things about their lives that I did not know, some of them significant. When I learned how they had to abandon the family farm because of the dust storms and travel to California with all their possessions with two little children and almost no money.

During the party my cousin Sarah offered to come live with them to help them get treatment to combat their advancing age. What a nice thing to do. It will be a win win for all, because Sarah will be going to school just 10 miles from where my grandparents live. Life is simply wonderful to be part of such a close knit extended family.

I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal. Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier. Due to starting a family shortly after receiving my Bachelors degree, I had put off getting my Masters until my life had settled and I was financially capable of achieving this goal. Well, that time came 2 years ago when I took the step of enrolling in school at the age of 46. Did I need the Masters degree? Would it change my life? Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful? Well, yes I did need the degree and yes it would change my life. I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family. It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it. So many emotions ran through my mind. Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here? I knew that they were looking down upon me and this day and were just as proud as they would have been if they were here to see it with their own eyes.

I'm glad it doesn't take place at the same location every year, so that's a positive aspect. I rarely visit the capitol so at least a bit of excitement was added to the mandatory plane trip. I would have preferred at least one night's stay in a decent hotel instead of having to fly back on the same day. That is way too much flying for me and maybe even most people. It felt like a waste of resources and there could have been a better, less wasteful alternative to the entire event. It's difficult to say whether or not I had a good time considering I spend the entire day being anxious about traveling on two different airplanes. If the annual event next year is two plane trips in one day, I may have to find a way out of it. I don't think I could handle another stressful travel day like this one. Speaking of stressful, my nerves were so shot from the traveling I decided once I landed I needed a stiff drink or several to take the edge off. Thankfully I arrived home safely and as soon as I got off the plane, I was calling my best friend. I didn't want to go out for a drink alone. Luckily she was considering going out for a few drinks anyway and hadn't found anyone to go with. We met up at our favorite local bar and had quite a few drinks. We eventually became exhausted and it was late anyway, so we shared a cab so we could safely get home. I'm glad she was able to join me. To my surprise the day turned around because my evening with her was so enjoyable.;The summary details my day as I flew to my company's annual event at the state's capitol. I flew there, attended the event, and flew back on the same day. Upon returning home, I grabbed a drink with a friend and went home.;21;379;deceptive

I was worried we were moving to fast: he only proposed two months ago. But I don't care if we did move to fast, I just know this is what I wanted. The ceremony was a small get together at my parent's. We only invited close family and friends: about 25 people. John's parents were so happy for him. My mom cried and cried. I'm glad we decided not to keep it small and manageable: I would have been way more nervous than I already was if it was some big extravaganza. In fact, I was so nervous I had to hire some catering. I had planned to cook the entire meal myself, but it was just too much with my nerves and all. So, I ended up making a few of my family's favorite dishes and a few of John's family's favorites (For the record, John's sister helped out with those recipes). I then found a caterer and had them bring some complementary dishes to round the meal out. We were on a tight budget (who wants to start marriage in debt?), but so many of our family and friends tipped in to help out with every thing that it all looked great and went very smooth. I think everyone had a great time!;This summer, my boyfriend and I decided to get married. We planned a small ceremony at home for our families to attend.

1837;3E47SOBEYRIAJV71JJHF2W1NHU7IC6;I'm thrilled to be writing that my friend has successfully worked their job for the last four weeks and integrated into their new workforce without issue. I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend.;Helped a friend to find a job.

69;30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C71PZ09;I almost killed someone last month. I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.  The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that.

It was a really long day at work, with an early afternoon meeting that stretched well past dinner time.  By the time I was leaving work, I was physically and emotionally worn out on top of being very hungry.  I have a long commute home, it was raining, and I heard that traffic was particularly heavy for that time of night.  I decided to drive straight home and eat dinner at home instead of stopping.  As I entered the highway, the rain had started to come down almost torrentially, it was really difficult to see.  Immediately, I could tell that the driver in front of me was struggling.  She was going very slowly and seemed to be riding the white line.  As we neared where the traffic was supposed to pick up, she twice nearly drove off the side of the road.  I was worried about her, but also about my safety because her driving was unpredictable.  I wanted to pass her at my first opportunity, but I slowed down and gave myself some room in the meantime.  Once I could see the red brake lights from the traffic jam in front of us, I started to feel a little better because I knew the driver in front of me would have to stop and the traffic jam would keep her safe for a while.  I couldn't believe it when, just before we reached the traffic jame, she suddenly sped up and took a hard right turn right off the road and into the woods.  I swear I could hear her scream from the woods as I drove by.  I never saw myself as someone who would stopped to help in this situation, but something came over me and I just pulled over without thinking.  I ran into the woods and the scene was horrible.  The driver was an elderly woman and her small car was upside down and crunched really badly.  She was screaming in pain and I could tell she was really bloody.  I quickly called 911 and broke down the scene before I took a real hard look into the car.  The woman was in rough condition, couldn't move because the car was upside down, and she seemed absolutely terrified.  I knew I couldn't really help her, but my heart was breaking for her.  I laid down on the ground and held the woman's hand.  I tried to talk calmly with her until the ambulance and rescue workers came.  She begged to hold my hand again after she was removed.

We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter.

I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand.

Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications.

I was scanning through Craig’s list, when I saw this video of this little guy. He was cream colored and his 11 other siblings were playing boisterously on top of him. Next scene, there he was again, everyone piled on top of him. Instantly I knew, he is the one. My husband and I took home home, it cost us $60 and he came completely full with fleas!I called the vet and begin my monumental task of getting rid of the fleas. It was very tedious, and time consuming. We called him Ash, after the Pokemon master, my children favorite show. I taught him to sit, roll over, high fives, shake hands and we played hide and seek for hours. He was very energetic and frisky. He would run over to me from wherever, when I said the word,  “ready”. He rushed over to watch me unplug the sink after dishwashing and watch the water swirl down the drain. He followed me everywhere! He was precious, my companion.   I was on vacation in London for my son’s graduation when that horrific call came. It was 100 degrees.  My other son called frantically that Ashton is at the vet. My heart was racing, when he told us that he had severe urinary  tract problem and kidney disease. He might not survive. Few hours later he was gone. Just gone. I cried and grieved for days, and could not stop talking about him. I looked at all his pictures, and videos. He was supposed to be with us for another 10 years.;The loss of my favorite, my cat Ashton or Ash. Smart, mischievous and sharp, he captured everyone’s heart.;25;278;truthful

My step-daughter Julie and her husband took me and my husband out for lunch at a fancy little restaurant in town. I was excited to try this place out because I had never gone there before. I was so happy to be able to spend the day with my step-daughter, I hadn't seen her in a while. When we got to the restaurant we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers. I noticed Julie and her husband kept glancing at each other during the meal, I just thought they were being silly. After the food got to the table then both put their forks down and said they had something to tell us. I was nervous because I thought something bad had happened. Julie had cancer several years ago and I always worry that it will come back. Imagine my surprise, and relief, when they told me they were expecting a baby! My first grandchild! I nearly fell out of my chair. I have always wanted a grandchild. Julie was told many years ago that she would most likely struggle with fertility as a result of her cancer treatment, so we never really expected her to be able to have a baby.

Intrigued, I visited the rescue dog shelter. There were many dogs, very excited to see people. There was one, however, that I really connected with. His name was Rufus, a German Shepherd. After talking to the rescue dog shelter volunteer, I applied to adopt a dog and requested Rufus. After waiting on pins and needles for a week, I finally got a call from the rescue dog shelter. Rufus was officially mine, and I can go over to pick him up! For the next 10 years, we had so many good memories. We spent a lot of time on walks, being active in the backyard, and even some of the mischief he had caused.  He had this long face any time he looked at me, but he was a very happy dog whenever we had visitors or just going about everyday life. The joy he brought into my life is immeasurable. After 10 years, he passed away from old age.  I was heartbroken. I knew the time would come, but I never wanted it to.

387;336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U839M5M;I planned my retirement a year in advance after I gave my notice at my place of employment that I was ready to retire. Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active. I like the moments I am living with my family, I like that I am able to slow down, I like to know that I have the world as my oyster and most importantly I like to know that I am developing so many memories with all of my loved ones.;I retired five months ago and am as happy as I've ever been.

Maria picked out a pink t-shirt that says ""I <3 MERMAIDS"" with a pretty picture of a mermaid on the front, a pair of  jeans, and pink socks.  So last night I helped her pack her backpack with the school supplies we just bought.  Of course, all the items that could be pink in color were pink!

A few days before my birthday my old car died. It just stopped working. It was pretty old, but I expected to be able to use it for a few more months at least. The car had other plans, though. The transmission blew. The mechanic told me it would cost more than the car was worth to fix it. I was devastated. I needed a car to get back and forth from work.

I changed into my pajamas and settled in on the couch to watch our shows. Suddenly my husband ran down the stairs and grabbed my hands. He pulled me off the couch and towards the front door. I remember being so annoyed, I wanted to watch television and be left alone. He swung the door open and there it was. A new car! He had somehow managed to get me a car.

We were separated at a very young age and I never really knew much about them. I used to ask my parents what was she like and if they knew how and what she was doing. Hearing them talk about what her just made me so eager and excited to one day hopefully actually meet her. So one day I decided to go ahead and do some digging to try and find her and see if we could speak. Sadly I came up with no results and that was kind of heartbreaking at the time because I just felt that if I couldn't find her then, I would never actually meet up with her. So I felt gutted for that but in a turn of events, I was sent a message from someone she knew. I instantly replied and we got something set up. My sister and I had a conversation and it was so amazing for me because I always had so many questions. She answered every question I had and she definitely had questions for me. I was more than happy to answer any and everything she wanted to know about me, because that's my sister. So for me this was a great time over-time though we ended up planning a face to face meeting and we met the airport. We embraced and had a big long hug and we both cried actually.

We also import things that we need and we have good trade with people on the outside. THe older people are not sure that the hotel chain is a good idea. Some villagers think that it will allow us to expand and take on more money from the outside. Others think that we will just be employed by the hotel and lose our way of life as we turn into servants. They also think that the natural beauty of the place will be destroyed and that is a shame just to bow down to corporate interests.

While I did not know anyone else in the crowd, I felt a oneness with them, as we were all fans of the band and knew all of the songs by heart. I had had two beers before the concert, but the euphoria I felt while dancing with other fans was a different sort of intoxication that did not require alcohol at all.

We decided to renew our vows in front of friends and family. We all traveled to Charleston, South Carolina. It is a romantic town with personality and history. We thought it would be fitting for our relationship. It was a romantic weekend of love and memories. We had 40 guests from all over the country. We spent the weekend eat, drinking, and being merry. We shopped and hit all of the tourist destinations. Everyone had a blast spending time together. Our actual renewal ceremony was lovely. I wore a white dress and our kids were in the bridal party.

I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert.  It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT.  It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason.  My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.  He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife.  She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.  Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert.  She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.  She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.  She passed away that night.  We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.  My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away.  He said it just didn't feel right.  After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go.  His oldest son took her place.  It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed.

I thought this was strange because my mom always handles stuff like that. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, but I could tell it was something. We hung up and went to my husband in the backyard, I told him that something was weird and I was worried. About 10 minutes later I got another phone call that my mom was in the hospital and my dad asked if I could come up to the hospital. I started to panic, kissed my husband and ran out the door. When I arrived at the hospital I found out that my mother was having a heart attack. I was scared but quickly found out that she was okay. That is when the anger set in. I was angry at my dad for not immediately telling me what was happening. I was angry with my mom for refusing the ambulance at immediate care and thinking they could drive to the hospital. I was angry at them both for not having the common sense to go to the hospital immediately instead of bothering with immediate care. After mom was admitted we found out that she would need a heart cath.

During this time I was to abstain from social media, television, lustful thoughts, cursing, swearing, and sweets for 1 month. The purpose of this cleanse was to test my willpower. In addition to this, I made it my priority to test my spiritual faith during this time, The cleanse proved to be difficult at first but became progressively easier. During the first week, I struggled to tame my mind in the presence of temptation. I did experience a significant relapse. It was discouraging. After the first 2 weeks, I felt more clear minded. After 3 weeks, I felt stronger both spiritually, physically, and mentally. I was able to keep my composure in stressful situations with less effort. At this point, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. After the 1 month period, I began to question how was I suppose to transition back to regular life. The cleanse ultimately did the job.

You just cant be too careful when choosing roommates.  I might have to get a lock for the bedroom door and hope Mike remembers when he drinks his damn beer.  He gets real mean when he is drunk.  Of course, you dont figure this out until you have a signed a lease.  Scott is OK, but he is kind of just there.  There are a couple of people I know who might make good roommates when this is over.
